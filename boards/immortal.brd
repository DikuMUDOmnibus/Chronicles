Well, first of all I'd like to welcome you to my codebase. I created
this base with help from a small group of trusted friends, and I have
enjoyed creating it. I hope, in turn, that you enjoy using it.
 
For a list of all the changes made to this codebase, simply type the
command 'news all' and they will be shown.
 
Before you continue, I urge you to read the license agreement, which is
in the MUD's "doc" directory. If you do not read the document, you are
still bound to it... so before using this I STRONGLY urge you to read it.
 
Thanks much,
           Orion Elder
