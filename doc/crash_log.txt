The Chronicles Crash Logging System
-----
This system is not highly complex. It is, however, still under the Chronicles license 
agreement. As such, I highly suggest you read this agreement if you decide to copy this for 
your MUD.

The system itself is actually a part of the startup script itself. The script checks to see 
if it finds a core file. If so, it assumes the MUD died due to a crash (a likely assumption, 
really).

In the event that a core file is found the script will then append the CTDH (Crash Trace 
Data Header) to the end of the log file. Afterwords it then prints a GCDF (GDB Commands Data 
File) which is passed into GDB to get the backtrace data from the core. This information is 
appended to the log file, as well. The script then removes the GCDF (keeps your directories 
clean), and renames the log file from .log to .crash (to alert you that CTD has been 
appended to the file). Finally, it moves the core to the source directory and appends .old 
to the core file.

The CTDH resembles this:
-----[ Crash Trace Data ]-----

This system is made, hopefully, to provide backtrace data, notify you that there HAVE been 
crashes (sometimes they're easy to miss), and basically to give you some help in keeping 
your MUD up and running.

Thanks go out to Samson for some of the ideas behind this. :)
