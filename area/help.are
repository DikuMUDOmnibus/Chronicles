#HELPS

0 !~
Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~

0 "REMOVE INVIS"~
Syntax: cast 'remove invis' <object>
 
This spell will make an invisible object in the character's inventory
visible.
This is an AGGRESSIVE spell when used on others. I.e, it will attack 
another player if you attempt to use it on them.
~

101 AASSIGN~
Syntax: aassign <filename>.are  Example:  aassign edo.are
 
AASSIGN temporarily assigns all rooms, objects, and mobiles in the area
range to your pfile.  This allows you to use rlist, olist, mlist, and
reset list.  This also means that typing savearea, reset area, or 
instazone will affect this area.  
 
To save changes permenantly, type "aassign none" and foldarea.
 
&rWarning&w!! Do not have an area aassigned to yourself when getting personal
vnums assigned to you.  The personal vnums will overwrite the area file.
 
In order to assign a proto area to yourself, you must either have that
area bestowed to you by a Greater God or higher.
 
In order to assign a nonproto area to yourself, you must either have
that area bestowed to you by an Exalted+. Even if you have the area bestowed
only Lesser+ can aassign themselves nonproto areas.
~

1 'ACETUM PRIMUS'~
'Acetum Primus,' is the third and most powerful of the known acid
disciplines at the Mage's disposal.  This incantation pulls forth the
strongest caustic agents in the casting Mage's neighboring planes,
and propels them in a tight cyclone-like blast towards the Mage's
chosen victim.  The cross-dimensional disturbance, the physical
violence, and the bonescouring potency of the conjured compound all
work together to effect an estimable estrapade.
~

1 'ACID BLAST' 'BURNING HANDS' 'COLOUR SPRAY' FIREBALL 'LIGHTNING BOLT'
'MAGIC MISSILE' 'SHOCKING GRASP'~
These are all attack spells and should not be used against another player
unless both you and the other player are listed under 'who deadly' and are
within the legal pkill level range.

1) Syntax:  cast fireball         <victim>
2) Syntax:  cast 'acid blast'     <victim>
4) Syntax:  cast 'colour spray'   <victim>
5) Syntax:  cast 'shocking grasp' <victim>
6) Syntax:  cast 'burning hands'  <victim>
7) Syntax:  cast 'magic missile'  <victim>
 
Each of these spells inflict variable damage on the victim.  The higher the
caster's level, the more damage inflicted.  The spells are listed by their
inherent power from strongest to weakest, though differences in strength
are in many cases minimal.
~

0 'ACID BREATH' 'FIRE BREATH' 'FROST BREATH' 'GAS BREATH' 'LIGHTNING BREATH'~
Syntax: cast 'acid breath'      <victim>
Syntax: cast 'fire breath'      <victim>
Syntax: cast 'frost breath'     <victim>
Syntax: cast 'gas breath'
Syntax: cast 'lightning breath' <victim>

These spells are for the use of dragons.  Acid, fire, frost, and lightning
damage one victim, whereas gas damages every PC in the room.  Fire and
frost can break objects, and acid can damage armor.

High level mages may learn and cast these spells as well.
 
Be aware that area attacks are aggressive to all mobs in the room,
including pets, mounts and charmed creatures.
Gas breath is an area attack, the other breath spells are not.

-1 AD ADS ADVERTISING~
.
It is against the rules of this mud to advertise another mud either on
public channels (say, chat, ask, answer, shout, yell, music, quest, avatar,
newbiechat, any guild, order, clan or council channel, wartalk or racetalk),
through your title, description, or biography or via leaving a note on any
public, guild, order, clan or council board in the Realms.  If you are
asked to desist and do not do so immediately, your priveleges on this mud
may be restricted or terminated.
 
~

104 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

101 ADVANCEDEXITS~
SMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction, as well as
the special direction 'somewhere', represented by a '?'.
 
If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one, use
a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:
  redit exit +n 3001          - Adds another exit north to room 3001
 
To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to refer to
it by number:
  redit exit #2 3002          - Change the second exit to go to room 3002
  (to know what number an exit is, do an "rstat")
 
For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one of
the extra flags (see EXFLAGS) like CAN_CLIMB.  It's also usually a good idea
to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer to those
with autoexits on.
 
The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:
  redit exit ? 3001           - Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
  redit exflags ? auto hidden - Set the proper flags
  redit exname ? swim         - Set the keyword "swim"
  ... here, if a player types 'swim' in the room they will move to room 3001

-1 ADVENTURE~
.
   In our efforts to give credit to everyone who deserves it, we almost
   forgot to give credit to one of the "grandfathers" of computer adventure
   games... David Platt, the author of the original "Adventure" (c)1979.

   Also credit to Ken Wellsch for porting the original Fortran-77 version
   to UNIX-C (over a period of about 3 years) (c)1984.
~

1 AFFECTED 'AFFECTED BY'~
Syntax:  affected       (abbrevation:  af)
Syntax:  affected by    (abbreviation: af by)
 
'Affected' is a spells-at-a-glance function, which displays only the spells
(and skill affects) your character is currently under.  Each affect will be
listed by name only for the sake of brevity (if you want to know what each
is doing, use help <spell/skill name> or 'score').
 
Characters level 20 or above and deadly characters will also see the number
of rounds remaining for each affect.  Affects with a remaining lifespan of
less than 25 rounds are displayed in white, and those in immediate danger
of wearing off will flash.
 
'Affected by' displays a character's affects separate from its spell/skill
affect list.  This is useful for ensuring that affects given from equipment
are actually functioning.  For example, if you are wearing a visor with
detect_invis but 'affected by' does not show you as having that affect, you
are not detecting invisibility.
 
'Affected by' also displays your current susceptibilities, resistances and
immunities if your character is level 20 or higher.
~

101 AFFECTEDBY AFFECTED_BY~
The following are affect flags that can be used when osetting an item
(with oset <item> affect affected <affect flag>).  These flags can also
be used when msetting a mobile (mset <mob name> affected <affect flag>).
They may additionally be used to mset players if your level allows it.
 
Blind          Invisible    Detect_evil  Detect_invis  Detect_magic
Detect_hidden  **Hold**     Sanctuary    Faerie_fire   Infrared
Curse          **Flaming**  Poison       Protect       Paralysis
Sneak          Hide         Sleep        Charm         Flying
Pass_door      Floating     Truesight    Detect_traps  Scrying

wildcard as well.  Be carefull however as *.edu would ban everysite from .edu,
or *foo* would ban anysite that had the string foo in it.

banned and by who.  Number can be a class or race name, a site address or
you can use # followed by the ban number.

The undead can only exist in the living realm for a short period of time before
returning to the underworld.
~

1 'AQUA BREATH' 'AQUA'~
Syntax: cast 'aqua breath' <character>
 
This spell allows you to breath in water areas and underwater.  Certain
water sectors will require the use of aqua breath to prevent damage from
drowning.  If you are in an area and your movement suddenly begins to

aqua breath immediately or leave the area.
 
~

1 AREAS~
Syntax:  areas
Syntax:  areas info <area name>
Syntax:  areas <low range> <hi range>
 
The 'areas' command displays an alphabetically sorted list of all areas
within the game, together with the author and suggested level range of
each area.  
 
The 'areas info' command displays information about a particular area,
including anyone who has derived upon that work.

You can specify a level range to see a list of all areas with suggested
ranges which encompass the argument.  This can be a little awkward as
each area has a low and a high suggested range.  Suffice to say that if
an area's level range matches even one level of the range you request,
it will be displayed.
 
Special thanks to Fireblade for design and coding of this restyled function.
~

0 ARMOR~
Syntax: cast armor <character>

This spell decreases (improves) the armor class of the target character
by 20 points.
~

101 ARMORCLASS~
.
&gThere are two values used with armor class for object type Armor:
 
&GValue0: Variable amount based on level of item at repop.
Value1: Maximum repairable armor setting for the object.
 
&gSetting Value0 has no effect. It will re-adjust itself on repop based on
the repop level of the item. Setting Value1 below the expected repop value
for Value0 will result in an item that cannot be repaired until Value0 drops
below Value1's setting. The listing below gives you a rough approximation of 
the values returned for Value0 based on level:
 
&GLevel Invoked   Value0   Level Invoked   Value0   Level Invoked   Value0 
-------------   ------   -------------   ------   -------------   ------   
      1           1-3         10           3-5         20           6-8
     30           8-10        40          11-13        50          13-15
     
&gThe amount that Value0 is set to determines the amount the player's A.C. will
be adjusted. Different wear locations have a different multiplying affect:
 
&G0 X Value0: Wield, Ears.
1 X Value0: Arms,  Finger, Neck, Feet, Hands, Shield, Waist, Wrist, Hold, Eyes.
2 X Value0: Head,  Legs,   About.
3 X Value0: Body.
 
&gSee also OSET, AFFECTTYPES, WEARFLAGS, OBJECTFLAGS, OBJECTTYPES, ITEMVALUES,
WEAPONTYPES, VARIABLES, and OMENU.

1 'ASTRAL WALK' 'FARSIGHT' 'PORTAL' 'HELICAL FLOW'~
Syntax:  cast 'astral walk'  <victim>  Syntax:  cast 'farsight'     <victim>
Syntax:  cast 'portal'       <victim>  Syntax:  cast 'helical flow' <victim>
 
These spells allow the very shape of space and time to be warped at the
caster's bidding:
 
'Astral walk' instantaneously moves the caster to the victim's location.
 
'Farsight' allows you to see the room in which the victim stands.
 
'Portal' forms a temporary tunnel through space to the victim.  A portal
will not succeed if a portal already exists in either the caster's or
the victim's location.  Type 'enter' or 'enter portal' to pass through.
 
'Helical Flow' morphs an Augurer into a coil of colour which instantly
travels to the victim's location.
 
These spells may fail if either the victim or the caster is in a location
which blocks their use, such as no-recall areas, no-summon areas, etc.

2 ATTACKER ATTACKERFLAG ATTACKERFLAGS~
&PAttacker &Wflags are automatically given by the mud code to players
who engage in illegal attacks upon other players. These attacks can
initiated by using MURDER, casting an attack spell, or ordering
followers to attack a player. Deadlies attacking Deadlies do not
receive Attacker Flags. These flags are only given out in situations
that involve Peaceful players, i.e. Deadlies attacking Peacefuls,
(or vice versa), or Peacefuls attacking Peacefuls. You will be
tagged with an &PAttacker &Wflag if:
 
  1. You attempt to MURDER another player, or they attempt to
  MURDER you. (See &CHelp Murder &Wand &GLaws Pkill &Wfor more info
  on attacking other players).
 
  2. You order charmed mobiles or pets to attack a player, or you
  are attacked by another players mobiles. (See &CHelp Charm &Wor
  &CHelp Pets &Wfor more info)>
 
  3. You are a &RDeadly &Wplayer and attacked a fellow Clanmember.

&WDarkhaven Guards, shopkeepers and special function mobs now respond
differently to illegal flags. You may find yourself barred from making
purchases, placed before Judge Kendra for a hearing, or sentenced to
jail. Should you acquire an &PAttacker &Wor any other illegal activity
flag, see Judge Kendra in Townhall. Her Honour is located one west of
the Main Lobby (See &CHelp Townhall &Wfor info).

1 AUC AUCTION~
.Syntax: auction (abbreviations: a , auc)
Syntax: auction <item name> <starting value>
Syntax: auction bid <value>
 
The auction command is used for performing auctions.  Simply typing auction
will display the current item being auctioned, if there is one.  
 
If nothing is being auctioned, auction <item name> <starting value> will 
begin an auction.  If no starting value is specified, it begins at 0 gold.
 
Auction bid <value> will place a bet for the item.
 
Special thanks to Erwin Andreasen for writing this function.
(Ported to SMAUG from a publicly available source.)
 
At the present, if the mud crashes in mid auction, you will lose both 
your bidded money and the item.  This will at some point be fixed.
 
You are able to see auction almost from the point of character creation,
however, you cannot USE auction unless you're level FIVE or higher. To remove
the auction channel from your screen, type CHANNEL -AUCTION.
SEE also "help AUCTION2" for more on auction commands
&Y* Auctions will not be stopped for overbidding or misbidding*&w
~

1 AUCTION2~
Auction will also work with the following arguments:
 
au bid 20k      - bids 20000 coins
au bid 20k500   - bids 20500 coins (20,000 + 500)
au bid 20k5003  - bids 20500 coins, too (only checks first 3 chars after "k")
au bid 1m       - bids 1 million coins
 
On an existing bid of 10000:
au bid +10       - adds 10%, making the bet 11000.
au bid +         - adds 25% (the default if no number given), bet is 12500.
au bid x         - multiplies by 2, making the bet 20000.
au bid x5        - multiplies by 5, making the bet 50000.
 
It is illegal to auction <or barter, sell, trade> clan, order, or guild items.
Exception: Old clan equipment that was converted to be worn by both peaceful
           and deadly players.

0 AUGURER AUGURERS~
The Augurer is very strong-minded in its nature, both physically and
magically. It is very confident of its actions in combat, and this
confidence shows in its physical appearance.  The Augurer is of a
medium height, with a defined bone structure which shows both
intelligence and assurance.  Its appearance is wizened, but at times
the Augurer may look frail due to exhaustion.  Though it is of a
medium size, its physical strength is not.  The Augurer relies on
both brain and brawn to overcome its challengers.  When it is
confronted, its wisdom decides what course of action it should take,
and wisdom is its prime stat.
 
While in combat, the Augurer is capable of utilizing both spells and
skills to their greatest potential.  However, because of the Augurer's
size, it tires of magic easily.  To overcome this mental exhaustion,
the Augurer is a strong believer in the use of mana for rejuvination
of its magical powers, and uses a lot of it.  In its spare time, the
Augurer enjoys the local lore, both the teaching and learning of it,
as well as musical and theatrical pursuits.  The Augurer is a very
independent person, and spends much of its spare time in meditation,
reflecting upon the days activities.

tremendous degree of damage on unsuspecting victims if successful.
 
An appropriate weapon type is required to backstab, and if your victim
is wounded or suspicious it may not be possible to surprise them.  The
most important factor in anyone's ability to backstab is to catch the
victim when they are unaware of your presence.

the creature is your servant, and may assist you in combat and other
more minor duties.  Use the 'order' command to give them orders.
 
Be warned, you are responsible for the actions of your charmed beast.  If
it should go awry and take the life of another player-character, you will
be charged as a murderer and will be hunted by several creatures around
the Realms.
 
Aggressive mobs will lose their aggressiveness while charmed, but will
immediately return to their violent ways when the spell wears off.  For
this reason, charmed aggressive mobs should not be taken into any area
lower from the one from which they came, and should *never* be taken
into Darkhaven or the Academy.  Those found doing so will pay dearly.
 
As a matter of etiquette, charmed mobs should not be attacked.  You can
tell a mob is charmed if it is wandering "in a dazed, zombie-like state."
Be aware when taking your charmed mobs around other characters that any
area attack such as call lightning, gas breath or earthquake will hit
your creature and cause it to engage in combat.

~

101 COLORS~
The ability to color Help and other files is very useful. We ask
that you try to stick to these guidelines for color usage so that
we can have some consistency in their use:
 
Here are some outlines for using color on a white text file:
  &CHelp (Filename) &Wcolored cyan.
  &GLaws (Law) &WColored green.
  &PAttacker/Killer/Thief &Wcolored pink.
  &GOrder/Guild (Order/Guild) &Wcolored green.
  &RClans (Clan) &Wcolored red.
  &YSyntax  &Wfor sytax references, colored yellow.
  &CDeities (Deity) &Wcolored cyan.
  &RDeadly/Dealies &Wcolored red.
  &YConfig (+/- option) &Wcolored yellow.
 
If you wish to add other colors to your file, please use good
taste, make sure it is readable and don't get too whacky. If
you follow the above guidelines and stick to using white for
all other text, it will keep the text solid and legible. Should
you choose not to use any colors at all, that is also okay, the
above guidlines are merely for proper use of color, white is
always acceptable.
 
In addition, please keep in mind that the following topics should
not be colored except by their defaults:
  - Help (area name)
  - Help (skill)
  - Help (spell)
  - Help (class)
~

1 COMBAT~
You may choose a fight by finding a mob, and using LOOK, CONSIDER, and
IDENTIFY to gauge the difficulty of the opponent.  You can LOOK <mob>
to get a look at its equipment and description, this will often help
indicate how hard a fight might be. You can CONSIDER <mob> for a one
on one comparison of the mobs hitpoints and level to your own.  You may
also CAST IDENTIFY <mob> to get more detailed information about the mob.
 
You may start a fight by using KILL, MURDER, or many spells and skills
available to players.  The easiest way to start a fight is to KILL <mob>.
Currently, you may also MURDER <mob>, but this causes the mob to yell out.
 
You may find yourself in trouble during a fight, and wish to leave, this
can be done by using FLEE or RECALL.  You can flee a fight by typing FLEE.
You may recall from a fight with the spell 'word of recall' or by reciting
a recall scroll.  You may also set it up to flee automatically once you go
below a certain number of hitpoints by using WIMPY.  To use your wimpy, type
WIMPY or WIMPY <number of hitpoints>.  Leaving a fight with wimpy, flee, and
recall WILL cost you a loss of experience, with recall causing the greatest
loss.
 
For more information on combat, read section 12 of your Adventurer's Guide.

a note.  You may only read and post comments on players currently online.
 
Comments should be used for all disciplinary actions and warnings, on anyone
who makes frequent demands of or troubles for immortals in general even if
the player is not doing something specifically illegal, repeated problems,
after _all_ reimbursements, and any other information you feel would be
important to another Immortal when dealing with the player in the future.
 
If you have a disciplinary action and the player quits before you are able to
post a comment, please place a copy of the comment on the board located in
hell, room vnum 6.

~

0 CONTAINER CONTAINERS~
Containers are almost a necessity in the Realms.  They are used to carry
items, food, and drinks.  They help allow you to sort things, by using two
or more types of containers at once.  Corpses use many of the same commands
as regular containers.
 
EXAM <container> or LOOK IN <container> allows you to see what it contains.
 
GET <item> <container> allows you to take one item from a container.
GET ALL <container> allows you to take everything from a container at once.
GET ALL.<item> <container> allows you to take all of a particular item type
 
PUT <item> <container> puts an item inside a container.
PUT ALL <container> will put as much of your inventory in the container as
possible, until the container is full.
PUT ALL.<item> <container> will put as much of one type of item into the
container as possible, until the container is full.
EMPTY <container> will pour all of the contents onto the ground. 
EMPTY <container> <different container> will transfer the contents.
   Read your Guide to the Realms for more information on containers.

1 'CR' 'CORPSE RETRIEVAL' 'CORPSE'~
Before asking an immortal for a corpse retrieval, you &r-must-:&w
 
&r    -&w Attempt to get your corpse yourself, &rand
    -&w Use invis and hidden, this will get you past a lot of mobiles,&r and
    -&w Seek mortal assistance to retrieve your corpse.&r
    -&g If all else fails, wait at least 20 minutes after death to ask for an
      Immortal corpse retrieval.&w

**  "I need to leave now!" is not grounds for an early Immortal CR.
**  Corpses last approximately 40 - 60 minutes after the time of death.
**  Corpse decay will happen even while you are linkdead or after you quit.
**  Characters listed under 'who deadly' are not eligible for Immortal CR.
**  Corpses _will_ save over crashes and reboots, but will continue to decay
    once the Realms comes back online.  Log back on quickly to get corpse.

The cost for CRs is usually one item from your corpse.  An Immortal may
choose to charge MORE or LESS. 
 
&gAn Immortal corpse retrieval is not a right, but a privilege.&w  Pestering
or being demanding is cause for the Immortal to deny your request.  An
Immortal may refuse to do any CR at their discretion.  You may not barter
which items an Immortal can take from your corpse as the charge, the
Immortal's decision is final.
~

1 CRASH~
Crashes are unforeseen interruptions in the game that cause everyone
to be disconnected. If you type time and look at the system start up
time, you can determine if the game has just rebooted or if it was a
problem with only your character. 
   99.9% of the time corpses will save over a crash. The game will 
start back up with your character at the last place you saved or the
game saved you. 
 
See &WHELP REIMBURSEMENT &w and &WHELP SAVE &w

indicated by the use of _ _ around the messages, regardless of weapon
type.  Messages in all caps indicate even higher degrees of damage,
while those surrounded by * * indicate the highest levels.
 
The message shown will reflect the actual damage you are inflicting on
(or receiving from) your opponent, and not a specific fixed amount.
~

101 DAMPLUS~
.
For those unsure of what damplus is, it is part of the damage
equasion for a mob... ie:  10d6 + 10   (the +10 is the damplus)

1 DEADLYCLANS~
Clans are a society within Realms composed of a group of players which
have joined together under a common cause.  If you a member of a 
clan you have the ability to pkill other deadly players outside of your
own clan.  Depending on the clan in which you join, you may be asked 
to follow set of rules dictated by the clan's leaders. 

For more information on a current deadly clan type HELP <clanname>
 
NOTE: Non-deadly and deadly players may join a deadly clan, however
when the character is outcasted it remains deadly.
~

0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated at the Altar to Thoric in
Darkhaven (or your clan's temple).  Your corpse is left behind where you
were killed, together with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays with
you (the gods want you to have your gold).
 
Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death, and you lose
experience points as well.  Following/groups are not affected by death.
 
Corpses decay after time.  When this happens the objects inside a corpse
will decay with it.  Player corpses last roughly 30 minutes of real time.
Only the player who died or someone in their group can retrieve objects
from a player's corpse.  The only exceptions are for deadly characters,
who can loot each other's corpses at will.
 
If you have chosen a deity and have gained enough favor, you may be able
to supplicate to your god for your corpse.  Also see 'help supplicate',
'help deities', 'help favor' for more information on deities.
 
For more information on death, see section 13 of your Adventurers Guide.
 
~

1 DEATHTRAP DT~
A "death trap" refers to the scenario where one steps into a room and is
immediately awakened from death with no equipment or corpse. A corpse
recovery is not an option in this case as there is no corpse to retrieve.
 
There are also pseudo death traps that may appear to be a dt, but leave a 
corpse or transfer a corpse to another area. This is not a true dt. 
 
It is often advisable to look before one leaps and heed room descriptions.
DT's do not warrant a reimbursement, they are a part of the game. Gold, 
glory and favor are not affected by a death trap.

enemies, but slightly greater than those who simply evade.

0 DESCRIPTION BIO~
Syntax: description
        bio

The DESCRIPTION command puts you into an editor to edit your long character
description (what people see when they look at you).
The BIO command puts you into an editor to edit your personal bio: what
people see when they check WHOIS on you.
 
An Immortal can request you change your description or bio if it contains
inappropriate material.  Do not use profanity, racial slurs, sexual comments,
other players names (without their permission), or off-color remarks.  Refusal
to change your bio, description, or title on Immortal request is grounds for
loss of character privileges.

~

1 DEX DEXTERITY~
Dexterity (DEX in your 'score') represents your character's agility, and
it affects (among other things):
 
 - the maximum number of items you can carry at once in your inventory;
   with each additional point of dex you can carry additional items.
 
 - each additional point of dexterity also lowers (improves) your natural
   armor class.
 
 - the number of new moves you receive each time you level, as well as the
   number of moves you regenerate at each tick (when resting to refresh or
   regain movement points).
 
 - success chances with bash, stun and gouge, and helps determine whether a
   thief will be able to poison a weapon or tumble effectively.
 
Dexterity is also very important for quaffing potions in combat.  High dex
will allow you to quaff without dropping many potions during the heat of
battle, while a poor dexterity will cause you to accidentally drop many
of the valuable vials.
 
Dexterity is the prime attribute of thieves and vampires.
 
~

102 DICEFORMULAS~
To make the special SMAUG spells possible, special dice formula handling
had to be coded in.  (At least to make it nice).  This dice formula code
supports full BEDMAS expressions ( ) ^^ / * + -, plus extra mud related
operators and variables:
 
D dice         L level          H hit points      M mana
V movement     S strength       I intelligence    W wisdom
X dexterity    C consitution    A charisma        U luck

1 DIG DIGGING BURY BURYING~
Syntax:  dig
Syntax:  dig  <direction>
Syntax:  bury <item>
 
You can dig and bury items through the use of the dig skill and bury command.
Buried items are not visible to players, even through the use of spells such
as locate object.  To dig an item up, type dig with no arguments.  Having a
shovel raises your chance of success.  If you dig in a direction, you will
attempt to dig open an exit.
 
To bury an item (or corpse), drop the item on the ground and bury <item>.
Depending on the size and weight of the object, you might need a shovel.
 
* Note:  Deadly players can bury/dig up each other's corpses. *
 
Items buried will not last beyond crash or reboot.  Do not attempt to use
this skill for storage of items you wish to keep.

-1 DIKU~
.         SMAUG was originally based on the Merc 2.1 code which was
              based on the orignal DIKUMud code created by:

                       The Original DIKUMud Team:

          Katja Nyboe               [Superwoman] (katz@freja.diku.dk)
          Tom Madsen              [Stormbringer] (noop@freja.diku.dk)
          Hans Henrik Staerfeldt           [God] (bombman@freja.diku.dk)
          Michael Seifert                 [Papi] (seifert@freja.diku.dk)
          Sebastian Hammer               [Quinn] (quinn@freja.diku.dk)

                     Additional contributions from:

 Michael Curran  - the player title collection and additional locations.
 Bill Wisner     - for being the first to successfully port the game,
                   uncovering several old bugs, uh, inconsistencies,
                   in the process.

         And: Mads Haar and Stephan Dahl for additional locations.

  The Original DIKUMud was Developed at the Department of Computer Science
                     at the University of Copenhagen.

1 DISARM~
Syntax:  disarm
 
Disarm is an auxiliary fighting command to attempt to disarm your opponent.
Several things affect your ability to disarm or resist a disarm attempt
successfully, including your weapon and your stats compared to the weapon
and stats of your opponent.
 
You can only attempt to disarm your primary opponent, meaning you will be
unable to try to disarm a second or third attacker until you have disposed
of the first.
 
~

1 DISCLAIMER~
By continuing to play this MUD you are acknowledging that:
(1)  you are willing to abide by the decisions of the Immortals concerning
all issues involved in the game, and
(2)  conversation and situations may arise during the course of play that 
     may not be suitable for young children.

By these acknowledgments you hereby save and except this MUD and it's
Administrators from any and all liability that may arise during gameplay.

1 DISMISS~
Syntax: dismiss <target>

will negate the charm effect.
 
~

0 'DISPEL EVIL'~
Syntax: cast 'dispel evil' <victim>
 
This spell invokes the wrath of the gods upon an evil victim.  If you do
not specify a target, the spell's effect will strike you instead of a
secondary target.
~

0 'DISPEL MAGIC'~
Syntax:  cast 'dispel magic' <character>
 
This spell dispels magical affects on the victim.  It may be used as an
offensive spell to remove an enemy's magical advantages, or as a benign
spell to completely remove your own magical affects.
 
If you are not a mage, you must be affected by the 'detect magic' to be
able to use this spell.  Though mages do not necessarily need to use it,
being under the affects of 'detect magic' will reveal more information
unavailable otherwise or to other classes.
 
'Dispel magic' can be used by players and mobiles alike against either
players or mobiles.  It cannot remove affects from equipment, your race
or your deity; some other affects are immune to this spell as well.
 
When a caster successfully casts 'dispel magic' on themself they will
remove all of their dispellable magical affects.  If a mage successfully
dispels a victim, the number of affects stripped will depend on their
success and intelligence.  Otherwise a successful cast of 'dispel magic'
on a victim will result in the removal of a single affect each time
(victims will notice when and what affects are stripped).
 
WARNING:  this is an offensive spell, and its use on anyone other than
yourself will be treated as an attack on your target.
 
~

1 DISRUPTION~
With the spell 'Disruption,' the casting Mage causes his opponent to
be enveloped in a weird energy field that momentarily alters the plane
which the victim inhabits.  The spell was an early attempt by the Dark
Mage Thanatos to cause teleportation, but it was a failed attempt.  
Instead of teleporting it causes a horrendous nerve-wracking pain as
the victim exits and reenters his current plane of existence.

This command effectively secludes immortals from those of lower level. 
Each immortal has a personal dnd flag associated with their pfile. In
addition, each room can have a dnd flag associated with the room.
 
When your personal dnd flag is set, lower level imms can't 'at', 'goto',
'trans', sight you on 'where' or 'where (name). This does not affect LD 
immortals, they can still be transferred, even with the DND flag on. To 
see the flag's status, 'mstat self', it will be listed under 'pcflags'.
Syntax for room flag: redit flags DND
 
The DND room flag effectively blocks any 'at', and 'goto' commands
either to the room, or to a mob/object in the room. NOTE: It is only
in effect if:
a) there is an immortal in the room with their DND flag on.
b) the immortal attempting the commands is of lower level than the
   immortal with the activated DND flag in the room.

-1 DROW DROWELVES~
Drow are the darker, more evil cousins of Elves.  They were once part of
the happy community of Elves which roam the forests today, but have long
since moved under the ground, building vast subterranean cities and
complex networks of caves.

Drow have black skin and white hair, and are moderately weaker and have
a more slight constitution than average humans.  Still, like all Elves,
they have a slightly higher dexterity than men.

Members of this race specialize in spell casting, and have thus developed
a very high intelligence.  Being creatures of darkness the Drow tend to
fight more proficiently in the darkness, and have innate infravision with
which to discern objects and living things in the absence of light.
 
Drow gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.08
~

0 DRUID DRUIDS~
The druid is a lover and protector of the natural land.  Be it the forests
full of centaurs and deer, the streams full of fish, or the bug-infested
swamps, a druid always strives to protect and preserve nature.  Wielding
mighty spells from the gods themselves, druids strive hard at their work.
 
Strong in wisdom, with a body trained to near perfection by their rugged
lifestyle, a druid has many disciplines upon which to draw.  From powerful
spells of healing which can bring the near dead back to full vigor, to the
ability to mystically create water and food, to the awesome power of nature
which they command in battle via spells able to quake the land and split
the sky, druids demonstrate that mastery of magic is not just a hobby, but
a way of life for them.  Able to face many warriors on almost even footing,
and able to shield themselves nearly as well as some mages, druids are
truly a gifted class.
 
~

1 DUAL WIELD~
Characters with this skill are able to wield two weapons at once.  To
do so, the character must remove any 'held' item and any shield, then
simply wield two weapons.  Characters with strength under 25 may be
unable to dual wield two very heavy weapons.
 
Once two weapons are wielded, the affects of the skill are automatic.
 
~

0 DWARF DWARVES DWARFS~
Dwarves are relatively short (in Human terms), stocky and powerfully-built
creatures.  Long-lived and extremely sturdy, they are known equally as well
for their hardiness as for their cantankerous personalities.  Their thick,
stout frames lend them poor dexterity, but high strength and stamina.  This
race has produced some of the most reknowned fighters.  Dwarves possess the
inherent ability to see in the dark with infravision.
 
Dwarves average from four foot five inches and five feet tall, with dusky
complexions and thick, fur-covered torsos and limbs.  Both men and women
proudly wear and take pride in their beards.
 
Dwarves gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.97.
~

0 EARTHQUAKE~
Syntax: cast 'earthquake'

This spell inflicts damage on every enemy character in the room.

including pets, mounts and charmed creatures.
~

0 EAT DRINK~
Syntax:  drink <object>                  (drink liquid from a drink container)
Syntax:  eat   <object>                  (eat food or a magical pill)
         eat   <object> <container>      (eat directly from a container)
 
Drink instructs your character to drink from a fountain or a drink container
to alleviate thirst.
 
Eat instructs your character to eat an item of food or a magical pill (which
function in a similar fashion as potions); pills do not fill stomach space.
 
When you are hungry or thirsty (you will see messages at each tick that
tell you if you are starving or dying of thirst, and can check your
current state with either 'score' or 'oldscore'), you will not regain
hitpoints, movement points or mana back as rapidly as if you were well
fed and hydrated.
 
If you stay hungry or thirsty too long and you are not an Avatar, your
mental state will begin to suffer.  Your combat skills will be affected,
your coordination will suffer and you may begin to either hallucinate or
become depressed.  Eating, drinking and a little rest will solve this
problem after a short period of time.
 
See MENTALSTATES
~

1 EATING DRINKING HUNGER THIRST~
Eating and drinking are very important...
 
If you let yourself starve or dehydrate, your mental state will be affected,
and you may have problems performing even the simplest of tasks.
 
Typing 'score' will give you an indication of your current mental state.
('oldscore' will also show this information)
 
Sitting, resting and sleeping will increasingly contribute to better your
mental state (if done while not starving/dehydrating).
 
Being hurt badly in battle ("That really did HURT", and "You wish that your
wounds would stop BLEEDING so much!") as well as poisoning will also have a
rapid negative affect on your mental state.
 
~

101 ECHO RECHO~
Syntax:  echo      <color> <message>
         echo  imm <color> <message>
         echo  pc  <color> <message>
Syntax:  recho     <color> <message>
 
ECHO sends a message to all players in the game, without any prefix indicating
who sent it.  If 'echo imm <message>' is used, only level 51+ characters will 
see the message. If 'echo pc <message>' is used, only player characters will 
see the message. Echos should always adhere to the guidelines laid out in the 
Realm of Order (vnum 1214).
 
ECHO done in color should avoid the use of red and dark red unless it is a 
Urgent message containing important information related to the game.

RECHO sends a message to all players in your room, without any prefix
indicating who sent it.

~

101 ECONOMY~
Each area will initialize (on bootup of the mud) with a pool of gold based
on the area's range and the wealth of each mob in that area.
 
The shopkeepers and thieves will automatically deposit gold into the economy
if they are carrying more than a certain amount (the higher the level of the
shopkeeper, the greater they will carry before depositing).
 
To allow mobprogs to be created to manipulate area economies, making them
interactive and interdependent, there are two mpcommands:  mpdeposit, and
mpwithdraw (see related helpfiles).  There is also an 'if economy' ifcheck.
 
The aset command can also be used to adjust an area's economy by hand
(example:  aset <area filename> low_economy <amount>, this will give
the specified area a minimum economy at the level you set).
 
Mobs will not repop with more gold than what they were originally created
with, but if the area economy runs low they will begin to repop with less
until the economy is replenished (as they all share the same gold pool).
 
Use foldarea to make changes to an area's economy with aset permenent.
 
See ASET, FOLDAREA

Tall, slender creatures with an affinity for the woods and nature, Elves
are distant cousins to the Pixies and share the intelligence and dexterity
of that winged race to a lesser degree.  With a lighter frame than Humans,
what they lack in strength and stamina is made up for with their superior
agility - both in thought and movement.  Elves are capable in all classes,
though they function poorest in the role of pure fighter.  Most Elves will
prefer to stay close to nature, and many become druids.  All Elves have
the inherent ability to detect magic.
 
The average Elf stands taller than most Humans, being well over six feet.
Most have fair skin and long, straight hair, though there are individual
Elves who chose a darker life reflected in their outward appearance.

itself, the final syllables of the spell cause the fist to 
repeatedly and mercilessly pound into a victim of the caster's choice.

'Ethereal Fist' is a low-level Mage's best friend.

101 EXITMAKING~
The 'redit exit' command is used to create, modify and remove exits in a room.
Currently there can only be one exit in a certain direction.
The syntax of the 'redit exit' command is as follows:
redit exit <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keyword(s)]
direction: one of: n, s, e, w, u, d, ne, nw, se, sw or ?
vnum     : the room number in which the exit leads to.
exit-type: a number detailing the exit -- has a door, open/closed/locked etc.
key      : a number corresponding to a key object which can unlock the door.
keywords : keywords used to refer to the door, (or exit).

If only 'redit exit <direction>' is specified, the exit will be removed.
The 'key' field is optional when specifying keywords.  All other fields are
required previous to the field desired.

Examples:
redit exit n 3001           - Creates an exit north to room 3001
redit exit n 3001 3 gate    - Changes the exit north to have a closed "gate"
redit exit n 3001 3 15 gate - Changes the gate to allow use of a key vnum 15
redit exit n                - Removes the north exit

See EXITTYPES for generating the exit-type value.
~

0 EXITS~

~

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Syntax:  level
 
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  Type LEVEL to see
how many experience points you'll need for the next few levels.
 
You gain experience by:
    inflicting damage upon an opponent
    being part of a group that kills an opponent
    succeeding while learning a skill or a spell through real world usage
 
You lose experience by:
    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of some spells (energy drain, etc.)
    dying
 
The experience you get from a kill depends on several things:  how many 
players are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster;
your alignment versus the monster's alignment and some random variation.
 
Your last 50 kills are recorded.  Each time you kill a creature that has
been one of your last 50 kills you will receive less and less exp for it.
The creature will also learn from its experience with you over time; if
its intelligence is higher than your own it will begin to gain an
advantage over you in combat.

~

0 'EXTRADIMENSIONAL PORTAL' 'EXTRADIMENSIONAL'~
The Great Wizard Thanatos, after creating his fabled WarMagicks,
found himself snubbed and abused in and about The Realms for his
researches.  Much time would pass before mages and other classes
alike would learn the true power of these spells.
 
In the interim, disguised as an assassin, Thanatos became interested
in a more minor problem: that of carrying off the loot he gained
from all those he slew with Quantum Spike.  Realising that such a
formula would be easily grasped by his class, he thought to extend
it freely.
 
As a final touch to the spell, he thought he would spite those of
other classes by inbuing into these containers a quality which made
them unobtainable by the other classes.

deity for special services.
 
Note: If you deviate from your deity's alignment, you shall suffer a penalty
in favor for some actions.

0 GITH~
The Gith are a race descended from humans.  Once long ago, they were a
peaceful civilization of humans that were captured by mind flayers and
tormented for centuries.  Eventually, a savior named Gith led them to
freedom, yet their bodies had been flayed by the mental powers of the
illithids.  The Gith found themselves, stronger, quicker, luckier and
smarter than average humans, yet they had lost much of their faith,
wisdom, stamina and charisma.
 
They had yellowed skin and were very long of limb.  Sunken eyes peered
from yellowed sockets, now strangely capable of naturally detecting
invisible things.  The Gith race has split into three distinct groups
recently.  The good, the Githzerai, the selfish neutral, the Pirates
of Gith, and the evil, the Githyanki.
 
Gith gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.06.

0 GLORY~
Glory is a measure of how valiant you are, and is accumulated by taking part
in quests (mostly) and possibly in a few other ways in the near to distant
future.  It appears on your score screen as:
 
                    Glory: 264(430)
 
  The number in parentheses is the total lifetime glory attained by your
character, and the other number is your current glory.  Glory can be "spent"
to improve your items and weapons (among possible other things in the future)
as according to the scale detailed in HELP GLORY RATES.
 
   Unlike Quest Points of old, Glory will not only go to the "winner" of the
quest, but will be awarded on a basis of participation.  For example, the big
prize might not only go to the person who killed the monster,  but also to
the person who solved the riddle first, etc.  Players who took part in the
quest and helped a notable amount will also recieve lesser amounts of Glory.
 
   Glory cannot be traded or transferred between characters.  This would be
like Odysseus passing all the reknown for his deeds off onto someone else.

to buy an affect.

-1 GNOME GNOMES~
Gnomes are a quirky demi-human race.  Though not the mightiest of
races, they are well versed in their studies of knowledges, magics
and religions.  Additionally, due to their familiarity with such
lore, they tend to be more resistant to magics.  They can, though,
suffer tremendously from physical attacks.

Gnomes usually focus in the magical or clerical arts, though a few
rogues have ventured into the arts of thieving (albeit often not
very well.)

Gnomes are a short, stocky race, similar to their dwarven cousins.
Most often prefer an evening at home with a magical tome, a loaf of
pipeweed bread and a cup of ale over venturing out to battle.

Gnomes gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.2
~

your room vnum range; it shall be created for your to edit further with
REDIT.

You may not GOTO a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters

already present.

You may also "GOTO pk" to go to the site of the most recent illegal pkill.
See REDIT.

1 GOUGE~
syntax:  gouge
 
This attack can only be used in combat, and will strike at the eyes of
your opponent, causing damage and temporary blindness.

one of the primary combatants (i.e. is not tanking).
 
See also BLIND, BLINDED
~

1 GRASP 'GRASP SUSPIRIA'~
Syntax:  grasp
 
The suspiric grasp is the vampire's most lethal attack, allowing it to
drain the life of its opponent in larger quantities than nearly any
other skill or spell in the Realms.  The more intelligent is the
vampire, the more effectively it will perform this loathsome act.  Be
aware that the magical nature of this attack causes it to be affected
by the victim's saves.

1 GRIP~

your weapon tightly as someone tries to disarm you, making it far more
difficult to successfully disarm you.  This skill will only increase as
you are engaged in fights where someone is attempting to disarm you.

Grounding renders the victim resistant to electricity attacks.
This spell may not be used on a target.
~

1 GROUP GROUPING~
Syntax:  group <character>, group all, group, group disband
 
'Group <character>' adds someone who is following you into your group, making
them a group member.  Group members share experience from kills, and may use
the GTELL and SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will
automatically join the fight.
 
If character is already a member of your group, 'group <character>' again to
remove them from your party.  Removing the character from the group does not
stop them from following you, however.  A character can also leave a group
by using the 'follow self' command, in which case they will both leave your

2 GUILD GUILDS~
Guilds are special organizations for each class within the realms. Belonging
to a Guild has many advantages, such as gaining new knowledge of your class,
making new friends in the Realms, exciting quests, the great feeling of 
helping other players, and many other aspects of Guild life make being in a
Guild a memorable experience.  Each Guild has its own separate headquarter
with a healer, a practice room, a Guild store, and many other rooms that makes
each Guild unique unto itself.
 
Membership in a Guild is not something that is easily obtained, and you must
be a law-abiding player.  Deadly players are not allowed to join Guilds.
There are rules within each Guild, and along with these rules, you must
follow the rules of this MUD.
 
To gain entry into a Guild, you should speak with a leader of the Guild.  The
leaders are those people who have the title <Leader>, <First> and <Second>.
To find out who is on from a Guild, type "who 'Guild of *****'.  For example,
if you are a Druid, and you wish to find out who is on from the Guild of 
Druids, type "who 'Guild of Druids'", and you will be given a list of players
that belong to the Guild.
 
Type &Ghelp guild rules&w for a list of rules about Guild equiment and items.
~

2 'GUILD RULES'~
.
&RIt is illegal to sell, trade, auction or give away Guild items.&w Including
potions, pills, scrolls, equipment and containers.  Anything you can buy in
a Guild house is off limits for selling.  If you are found to be trading in
these illegal items, you stand the chance of not only being outcast from your
Guild, but your Guild may lose the ability to sell those items.
 
Please do not engage in buying such items either, as the Immortals reserve
the right to remove Guild items from ANY person not belonging to that Guild.
Just because you can buy it on the "black market" does not mean the Immortals
will allow you to keep it.
 
If you are in doubt whether an item is a Guild item, you are free to ask an
Immortal. Most Guild items have the name "guild" on it when you use identify.
 
There are rules that are specific to Guilds.  If you are not sure if something
is legal or illegal within your Guild, please contact a leader.

~

0 HALF-ELF HALFELF HALFELVES~
These beautiful creatures are the result of the mixing of human and Elven
blood.  Though the resulting Half-Elf is not as intelligent as the pure-
blooded Elf, nor as hardy as the full-blooded Human, this mix serves quite
well in a variety of classes which require the standards of both mental
and physical prowess.  Their beautiful almond eyes enable them to discern
objects in the darkness.
 
Not as tall as the pure Elf, they range from five feet six inches to six
feet five inches, with a heavier musculature than their ancestors.
 
Half-Elves gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.04.
~

0 HALF-OGRE HALFOGRE~
The Half-Ogre is a result of breeding during the dark days with humans,
when pure-blooded Ogres were known for raping and looting Human villages.
As a result of this, the Half-Ogre stands from six to nine feet tall in
height and is known for its muscle-packed body that can weigh from three
to four hundred pounds.  Most are relatively hairless, their bodies are
covered with small, boney growths, and their disproportionately long
limbs gives them a somewhat simian appearance.
 
This offspring of humans and Ogres has inherited great physical abilities:
an apptitude for aggression from its Ogre lineage, inherent infravision to
assist in traversing darkness, and though slightly smaller than pure-bred
Ogres it nevertheless boasts an awesome strength.  Being territorial, most
Half-Ogres will readily engage in battle to establish superiority over any
it encounters.  All in all a race best suited for the role of pure fighter.
 
Half-Ogres gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.92.
~

0 HALF-ORC HALF-ORCS HALFORC HALFORCS~
A recent mingling of Orcish and Human blood arising as the darker races
have encroached further upon the remaining settled areas, most members
of this half-blooded race are distinctly more Orcish than Human in both
appearance and behavior.  Large and dull of wit, with short but broad
bodies, their poor mental and physical dexterity is offset by an iron
constitution.  Though some have dabbled in the sorcerous arts due to
their human influence, brute combat is is still the natural call which
stirs in the soul of the Half-Orc.  All Half-Orcs possess infravision.
 
Though not as broad nor powerful as full-blood Orcs, Half-Orcs usually
retain their wider bodies, longer, bowed limbs and heavier musculature.
A ridged brow crowned by bushy eyebrows conceals small, squinting eyes;
below a snout-like noses opens a maw filled with crooked fangs; dark
skin emanating a rancid odor; their presence disgusts civilized races.
Standing from five to seven feet tall and averaging two hundred pounds,
an altogether fearsome race.
 
Half-Orc's gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.94.
~

0 HALF-TROLL HALFTROLL~
An intermingling (carried out in the darker lands of the Realms) of the
blood of the Troll with that of Humans, the Half-troll is as deadly as
it is hideous.  Though considerably smaller than full-blood Trolls, the
Half-troll often stands well over eight feet in height and carries over
three hundred pounds on its heavily-muscled frame.  Though naturally of
low wisdom, the race was sorcerously imbued with a wicked intelligence
and the ability to see naturally in the darkness.  Half-trolls usually
make poor pure magic users, and suffer from an unusually low dexterity.
Yet their boundless energy and high intellect create one of the most
cunning physical beasts of the Realms in experienced hands.
 
Owing in part to the black blood which courses through their heavy veins,
the heavily-scaled skin of the Half-troll ranges in color from a charcoal
grey to a deep, blackish green.  Half-trolls revel in the fright of their
appearance, often wearing their hair in battle-braids and emblazoning
themselves with brands and tattoos to accentuate the effect.
 
Half-Trolls gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.90.
~

0 HALFLING HALFLINGS~
Stout, round, open-minded and very elusive the Hobbit has a level
of dexterity which is only equal to his wit. Many enjoy the thrill of
reading a good book, or telling stories by the fire. Many halflings,
because of this, tend to avoid adventuring, though some rare hobbits
choose the path of the Bard, or storyteller, for their keen intellect
serves them well. This intelligence, coupled by a surprising
determination makes them a curious (though somewhat underpowered)
ally.

Halflings have compact bodies and thick, long limbs, and usually have
very hairy feet. Eye color range from blue, brown, green, and any shade
inbetween.

Halflings gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.02.
~

1 HEADBUTT~
Syntax:  headbutt
 
Headbutt is a skill which can only be used once a fight has started,
and can only be used against your primary opponent.  If it successfully
lands, it inflicts damage on your opponent.
~

103 HEDIT~
Syntax: hedit [help topic]
 
This command allows you to edit a help topic.  If the specified help topic
does not exist, it will be created for you. The default help page (summary)
will be selected if you do not specify a page.
 
NOTE - Always, when creating a new help entry, type Help <new entry name> 
       prior to creating your entry. A pre-existing help file associated 
       with that keyword may already exist.
&Y
Colors &wcan now be added to help files using the same command set that changes
a player's prompt. &bMultiple &Ycolor &wcombinations can be set on a given line
including ^bbackground^x colors. However there are a couple of quirks to take 
note of:
&Y
    1) At the very least, the first character of a help file cannot be
       either the symbol '&&' or the symbol '^^'.
    2) Color changes have to be separated by at least one character. ie,
       '&&Y.^^r' will work, '&&Y^^r' will cause problems. 
    3) Color codes are imbedded within text and _do_ count in note buffers
       for line length. ie, watch out for <Long Line Trimmed>.
&w
Colors should be used to &Yenhance &wthe help file, or specific parts of the 
help file. Tact and restraint should be used if considering the use of colors.
 
 
See HSET, PCOLORS.
~

101 HELL UNHELL~
Syntax: hell <character> <number> <hours or days>
Syntax: unhell <character>
 
The hell command sends a character to hell for a given period of time.  It
automatically releases the character when their time has been served.  Upon
being helled, the character receives the message, "The immortals are not
pleased with your actions.  You shall remain in hell for <time period>".
 
Hell takes arguments of either hours or days.  To hell someone for 3 hours,
"hell <character> 3 hours".  To hell someone for three days, "hell <character>
3 days".  Hell will default to hours if hours or days is not specified.
 
You may not hell someone for more than thirty days with the hell command.
 
To release a player from hell, simply "unhell <character>".
~

0 HELP~

1 HEZEKIAH HEZEKIAHS 'HEZEKIAHS CURE' HEZEKIAH'S~
Syntax:  c 'hezekiahs cure' <target>
         c  hezekiahs       <target>
 
Hezekiah was a great Paladin for whom the Gods showed great pleasure.
As a reminder of his greatness, the Gods granted a spell in his honor.
The spell brings about a mild cure to the wounded, with the use of
the Paladin Holy Symbol.
~

1 HIDE SNEAK VISIBLE~
Syntax:  hide
Syntax:  sneak
Syntax:  visible
 
If you successfully hide, creatures cannot see you unless they are affected
by 'detect hidden'.  Player characters can detect you, however.
 
If you successfully sneak, you can move from place to place without being
noticed by other player characters.  If you flee, you will stop sneaking
and will have to 'sneak' again.
 
In order to either hide or sneak successfully, you will have to practice
the appropriate skill.
 
Visible (vis) cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
effectively making you visible again to all.
 
~

1 HITALL~
Syntax: hitall
 
Hitall is a fighter skill that will start a fight by hitting all the
opponents in the room.  For nondeadly characters, the 'opponents' means
mobs, for deadlies it means all the deadly players in the room.
 
Be aware that area attacks are aggressive to all mobs in the room,
including pets, mounts and charmed creatures.
~

1 HITROLL HR~
Represents your chances of hitting your opponent.  The higher
the number, the better.
 
~

1 HLIST~
Syntax: hlist <low level range> <high level range>
 
This command will give you a listing of available help files. The list
is in alphabetical order based on the first triggering keyword. While
this command was initially designed as a maintenance tool to help us
track help files, it is also available to players so that they can
capture a listing of the help files available to them. 
 
Note - You may only view help files that are coded for viewing by your
       level or lower.
 
Note - The list of help files is quite extensive, and the command does
       not as yet have a way to filter/shorten the list. Screen capture
       is, at present, your only recourse.
~

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax:  hold   <object>
Syntax:  remove <object>
Syntax:  remove all
Syntax:  wear   <object>
Syntax:  wear   all
Syntax:  wield  <object>
 
Three of these commands will cause you to take an object from your inventory
and use it as equipment:
 
HOLD is for lights, wands and staves; WEAR is for armor; WIELD is for weapons.
 
You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.
 
WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD/WEAR/WIELD each suitable item in inventory.
 
REMOVE will take an object from your equipment and place it into inventory.
 
REMOVE ALL will remove all your equipment and place it into inventory.

1 'HOLY SANCTITY'~
Syntax:  c 'holy sanctity'

~

101 HOLYLIGHT INVIS~
Syntax: holylight
Syntax: invis

HOLYLIGHT is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

INVIS is a toggle which makes you completely invisible to all player characters
of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

When an immortal is INVIS, they will have a flag on the who list which 
indicates their level of invisibility, such as (51) for INVIS 51.  A 
similar flag will also appear when you 'LOOK' in a room - this flag will 
say (Invis 51).

HOLYLIGHT will not allow you to see immortal INVIS characters who are
higher level than you.
~

1 HOMEPAGE~
syntax: homepage <url>

~

103 HSET~
Syntax: hset  <command> [value] [help topic]
 save                            Saves all help pages (to help.are)
 level <level> <help topic>      Sets help topic to specified level
 keyword <keyword> <help topic>  Sets help keyword to specified keyword
 remove <level.><help topic>     Removes the specified help page
 
Note:  If you wish to set more than one keyword to a help topic, enclose all
       the keywords, space separated inside quotes.  (Like in spellcasting)
Note:  If you have instances of multiple help files with the same keyname,
       using Hset Remove without a level designation will remove the one with
       the lowest level of access. ie:
 
       Help file XYZZY at level 57, and help file 'SAVE XYZZY' at level 58.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE XYZZY' will remove the level 57 XYZZY.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE 58.XYZZY' will remove the level 58 'SAVE XYZZY'.

Setting a help entry level to -1 prevents the header from showing up 
when you view the help with the help command.

0 HUMAN HUMANS~
In the beginning there were Humans, Elves and Ogres. Humans are the most
numerous and the plainest race in the Realms. Although possessing no special
abilities or bonuses, they are the most adaptable and flexible race and are
able to assume any class. Humans are bipedal creatures with two arms 
and a roundish head. Their height, weight, eye and hair color vary greatly. It
is rare to find any two who look exactly alike. In dark times Humans and Elves
mated creating a new race, called HALF-ELVES (see help HALF-ELF HALFELF) and
Humans and Ogres mated created the Half-Ogre Race.  (See help HALF-OGRE, or
help HALFOGRE)

General Usage:
------------------------------------------------

List channels available                : i3 chanlist [all] [filter]
To tune into a channel                 : i3 listen <localchannel>
To see who is listening on another mud : i3 chanwho <channel> <mud>
List muds connected to I3              : i3 mudlist [filter]
Information on antoher mud             : i3 mudinfo <mud>
Ignore someone who annoys you          : i3 ignore <person@mud>
Make yourself invisible to I3          : i3 invis

i3 chanlist: Lists the channels the mud has available to listen to.
  Specifying 'all' will list the channels for the entire network.

i3 listen  : Tunes you in to the specified channel. You must meet or
  exceed whatever the minimum level is for that channel to do so,
  and your mud must have the channel configured locally.

i3 chanwho : Shows you who is listening to the specified channel on the
  specified mud. Invisble players will not be shown.

i3 mudlist : Lists the muds which are connected to the network.
  Specifying a filter will narrow the list down to only those muds
  whose information matches. IE: &Wi3 mudlist smaug&D will list all
  muds who have &Wsmaug&D as part of their listing.

i3 mudinfo : Lists the information provided by the specified mud.

i3 ignore  : Allows you to selectively ignore all contact with person@mud.
  This will block tells, beeps, locates, fingers, emotes, and whos. It will also
  block channel output from them, but will NOT block them from seeing YOU on
  a channel.

i3 invis   : Makes you invisible to I3. Performs similar to the ignore option
  except it prevents EVERYONE on the network from finding you. You will still
  be able to use channels, and you will NOT be invisible to others if you
  do so.

~

0 I3BEEP~
Syntax: i3beep <person@mud>

i3beep sends a quick message to a person on another mud.
If the target mud supports the beep tone, then the person
on that mud will hear the standard beep tone used by whatever
client software they are using. Works in the same manner as
the local beep command.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3EMOTE~
Syntax i3emote <person@mud> <message>

Sends a private emote to a person on another mud.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3LOCATE~
Syntax i3locate <name>

Asks all the muds on the Intermud-3 network if a person
known by the name is there. Be patient when using this command,
there are a lot of muds on the network to search through, so
a response may take some time to come back.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3TELL I3REPLY~
Syntax: i3tell <person@mud> <message>
Syntax: i3reply <message>

i3tell sends a private message to a person on another mud.
To send a tell to someone on a mud with a multi-word name, you need to
enlcose person@mud in quotes, like so: i3tell 'person@mud with long name'
Otherwise this command operates in much the same way as the local tell command.

To reply to the last i3tell you received, simply type 'i3reply'
followed by your message and it will be sent back to the last
person on I3 who sent a tell to you. Works in the same manner
as the local reply command.

                      You can use this form in room or mob programs and
                      you can have one room program check the number of
                      chars in a different room.
                      Note the number of characters is defined as the

1 IGNORE~
Syntax:  ignore
Syntax:  ignore <character>
Syntax:  ignore reply/none
 
Ignore allows you to ignore other characters in the Realms.  All tells,
says, socials, and emotes from these characters will be blocked (gagged
out).  You will still see their communications through public channels,
however.
 
Simply typing ignore will give you a list of all the characters you are
currently ignoring.
 
Ignore <character> allows you to add or remove a character from your list
of ignored players.  If the name is already on the list it will be removed.
If the name is not on the list it will be added.  Note that only the names
of actual characters will be accepted and that it is not necessary for
them to be logged on at the time.
 
Ignore reply will cause you to ignore the last person to send you a tell.
This can be used to prevent invisible people from spamming you.
 
Ignore none will set you to ignoring no one.
 
~

103 IMMHOST~
Syntax:  immhost add    <name> <host>
Syntax:  immhost delete <name> <host>
Syntax:  immhost save
Syntax:  immhost
This command is for setting the hosts allowed for immortals that are added
with this command.  Wildcards are allowed (*), so *edu, would allow any domain
from edu connect and 127*, would allow any local domain to connect.
IMMHOST without arguments will show a list of names and what domains they are
allowed to connect from.
To delete a command you need to provide the name and the host, this allows
for multiple hosts for a certain name.
This file won't be saved until the immhost save command is issued.

~

1 INFRAVISION INFRARED~
Syntax:  c infravision
Syntax:  c infravision <character>
 
This spell enables the character to detect the heat signatures of other
players and creatures in the room with them.  This spell will also allow
you to find items in corpses, containers, etc. but will not allow you to
view the actual contents.
 
You must have a light source to actually see items, room descriptions,
the contents of corpses or containers, room exits and the like inside
a darkened area.
 
Infravision is not the same as "night vision".
~

0 'INNER WARMTH' INNER WARMTH~

~

105 INSTALLAREA~
Syntax: installarea <area filename> <full area name/title>

Installs a prototype area into the mud as a non-prototype area.
The filename can be fixed with aset, (don't forget to foldarea the new name.)

Currently the builder should quit and have his/her vnums cleared manually.
(This should be fixed soon).
~

1 INT INTELLIGENCE~
Intelligence (INT in your 'score') represents your character's mental
capacity.  Among other things, it affects:
 
 - heavily influences the amount of mana a character gains at level
 
 - affects the amount of mana regenerated or recovered at each tick
   if a character is resting or sleeping
 
 - the rate at which a character learns a new skill or spell
 
 - the percentage rate at which a character practices a new language
 
Intelligence is an important factor in learning between combatants.  If
a character fights a creature several times, the more intelligent of the
two opponents will gain an advantage over time...
 
Intelligence is the prime attribute of the mage.
 
~

0 INTERMUD3~
Intermud-3 is a protocol which allows you to chat with people on
other muds who are also connected to Intermud-3. It is primarily
populated by LP based muds at this time, but the hope is to get
more Diku based muds to join over time. While some may say that
Diku based muds would be better served on the IMC Network, it
is far easier for a mud to obtain a connection to the Intermud-3
network, and the commands to use it are generally simpler.
The protocol itself is also cleaner and much less prone to attack.
In either case, should a mud desire it, Intermud-3 will coexist
peacefully with an IMC enabled mud. Currently, there is limited
support for cross-network traffic. This includes some channels,
private tells, and mudlists from either network. This may or may
not be expanded in the future.

--=[Bridged I3 Commands]=--
i3tell Name:MUD@IMC2 (message)
                - Sends a tell to a person on the IMC2 network.
i3who imc2      - Shows IMC2 network mudlist.

See also: I3, I3TELL, I3EMOTE, I3FINGER, I3WHO, I3LOCATE, IMC
~

0 INVIS 'MASS INVIS'~
Syntax: cast invis <character>
Syntax: cast 'mass invis'

The INVIS spell makes the target character invisible.  Invisible characters
will become visible when they attack.

The MASS INVIS spell makes all characters in the caster's group invisible,
including the caster.
~

101 IPCOMPARE~
Syntax: ipcompare <name>
        ipcompare <site>
        ipcompare <name or site> <room|area|world> <#>
 
This takes * as a wild card.
Ipcompare will compare online users to search for multiplayers. A positive
match using ipcompare does not always mean it is a multiplayer..but shows
that there are more than one user from a site on simultaneously.
Ipcompare <field> <#> will limit the output to x number of lines based on #.
* may be used as a wild card, for example ipcompare 207.18.3.* will return
matches from any that begin with the ip prior to the asterisk.
Ipcompare <field> <room|area|world> will limit the search based on that
criteria.  The room|area|world limitation will be judged on the room that
the immortal issued the command in.  So if you are in a different area
than the victim, it will show only players matching the site in the area
you are in.
~

101 ITEMVALUES~
In these values, 'sn' is a spell number;  a negative value means 'no spell'.

  attacked, set yourself to &YConfig +Nice &W(See &CHelp Config &Wfor info).
 
  2. You were the Master of a mobile which killed another player while
  under the influence of your charm. PLEASE NOTE that you will receive a
  &PKiller &Wflag even if the player that died attacked the charmed
  mobile without the Master's permission. Charmers and Pet Owners are held
  responsible for the actions of their Pets/Charmies. (See &CHelp Charm
  &Wand &CHelp Pets &Wfor more info on these topics).

  3. You are a &RDeadly &Wplayer and caused the death of a fellow Clanmember.
 
&WDarkhaven Guards, shopkeepers and special function mobs now respond
differently to illegal flags. You may find yourself barred from making
puchases, placed before Judge Kendra for a hearing, sentenced to
jail, or SLAYED by Harakiem.  You may apply to Judge Kendra in person to
seek removal of the flag. She is located one west of the Main Lobby in 
the Townhall. (See &CHelp TOwnhall &Wfor info)
Kendra in person if you wish. Her Honour is located one west of the
Main Lobby in Townhall (See &CHelp Townhall &Wfor info).

1 'KINDRED STRENGTH'~
Syntax:  cast kindred <character>
This spell increases the strength of the target character.
~

1 KNEE~
Syntax:  knee
 
Knee is a skill which can only be used once a fight has started, and
can only be used against your primary opponent.  If it successfully
lands, it inflicts damage on your opponent.
~

1 'KNOCK'~
Syntax:  cast 'knock'  <direction>
 
This spell enables one to unlock doors.
~

0 'KNOW ALIGNMENT'~
Syntax: cast 'know alignment' <character>

This spell reveals the alignment of the target character.
~

1 LANGUAGES~
Syntax: languages
Syntax: language learn <language name>

Languages alone shows which languages you know, and "language learn 
<name>" will add to your percentage of language knowledge.  To learn a 
language, a scholar who is knowledgable in that tongue must be present.

If someone is speaking in a language, and you know it, you will 
understand what they are saying.  However, to change the language in which 
you are speaking, you must change that manually.  (See help on SPEAK).

~

-1 'LAW ASSIST'~
.
&GA non-deadly may give, sell or trade scrolls, potions and equipment
with a deadly character.
 
A non-deadly character may spy for a deadly character.
 
A non-deadly may _not_ shield, heal, summon, help, hinder, portal or
otherwise assist a deadly character (this includes charm).
 
~

-1 'LAW CHANNELS'~
.
&GSpam (repeating the same message repeatedly or otherwise purposely causing
the screen to scroll), harassment (including sexual) and abusive behavior are
not permitted on any channel (this includes in 'say' or 'tell').  Do not
continue to 'tell' to someone after they have asked you to stop.
 
Profanity is not permitted on any public channel, which is a channel seen by
those other than yourself and the person to whom you are speaking.  If you
use profanity in a private conversation and the other party asks you to stop,
please respect their wishes.  The difference between '****, I'm having a bad
day' and 'what is your ****** problem' should be obvious to everyone.
 
If any level of Immortal asks you to desist on a subject, or to move the
subject to an appropriate channel, do so immediately.  Continuing on a
subject or channel after you are requested to stop may result in your
character losing its access to channels through silencing.  An Immortal's
decision on subject matter and/or channel use should be obeyed.
 
&WWarning:  &GArguing with or flaming immortals on channels _will_ get you
silenced or worse, and this may extend to your other characters as well if
you push the matter.  The Realms provides ample avenue for complaint without
resorting to public baiting and name-calling.
 
~

-1 'LAW CHARM'~
.
&GDo not bring aggressive mobs into or near Darkhaven, as when their charm
wears off (either naturally or by attack) their aggressive nature will
return.  Also do not bring aggressive mobs into areas which are lower in
level than the area from which the mob originally came.  You can use the
'areas' command to check an area's level.  See 'help charm' for more.
 
~

-1 'LAW CHEATING'~
.
&GCheating is a very serious offense and subjects _all_ characters involved
to a slay, purge (loss of all equipment), freeze, balzhur (destruction of
all equipment and public demotion to level 2), deny or even a site ban.
 
What is considered cheating?
 - exploiting (intentionally using) a bug to gain equipment or gold
 - intentionally causing the system to crash
 - intentionally duplicating equipment or gold
 - knowingly accepting illegal equipment (see above) from others
 - attempting to duplicate equipment or gold -- * even if not successful *
 - using or making profit from equipment that was accidentally duplicated
 - using gold that was accidentally duplicated
 
Cheating hurts the game, and every player in the game.  Protect yourself
and report any bugs you find, and inform the Immortals if you have strong
cause to believe someone is engaged in any of the above. 
 
If you find you have accidentally duplicated an item, turn the item over
_immediately_ to an Immortal or drop and sacrifice the item.
 
~

-1 'LAW HARASSMENT'~
.
&GHarassment is giving a person unwanted attention, whether you perceive it
as negative or positive attention.  If a person is made to be uncomfortable
by your attention or comments, you are harassing that person.  If a person
asks you to desist in talking to them or performing socials on them, and
you do not stop, you are harassing that person.  If you act in an intimate
manner to a character, without their permission, you are harassing that
person.
 
No form of harassment is tolerated in the Realms.  We especially frown upon
unwanted comments or actions with a sexual nature or explicit content.  If
you do not have an intimate relationship with the person, whether in real
life or within the Realms, you should refrain from using suggestive actions
and/or comments.
 
If you are caught harassing another player in any way, you can be silenced,
helled, frozen, denied, and/or site banned.  Harassing another player is a
serious violation of the rules and will not be permitted.  If you choose
to harass an immortal, you will simply be deleted.
 
~

-1 'LAW KILLSTEAL'~
Don't do it...
 
Kill stealing occurs when a player attacks a mob that is already being
fought.  This is both highly annoying and illegal.  If someone should do
this to you please inform them of the rules (ask them to read 'laws
killsteal').  If they continue, seek an immortal but do not take the law
into your own hands.
 
~

-1 LAW LAWS~
.
&GThe Realms are governed by a set of laws, most of which are simple common
sense and courtesy, and all of which must be followed to ensure everyone
the opportunity to enjoy the game.  As with any mud, a player's presence
here is a priviledge, not a right, and is something we reserve the right
to deny at any time at our discretion.
 
The Immortals of the Realms are responsible for enforcing these laws, and
their decisions these matters should be abided.  If you feel an Immortal
has treated you unfairly, you may petition directly to a level 56 (God)
or higher or you may petition via a note at the Oracle.
 
The decisions of a God or higher are final.  To see which Immortals are
online and visible, type "who 51" at any time.
 
To read the laws, type "laws <topic>" for any of the following:
&W 
       |  CHANNELS      |  PKILL     |  STORES  |  HARASSMENT  |
       |  MULTIPLAYING  |  SHARING   |  STAKE   |  CHARM       |
       |  OBJECTS       |  CHEATING  |  MURDER  |  ASSIST      |
 
&GFor further explanation, see section 2 of the Adventurer's Guide...
~

-1 'LAW MULTIPLAYING'~
.
&GMulti-playing is permitted within the Realms, with the following rules:
 
 - you may only have &Wone&G character link-live if it is a deadly character
   (if it appears under the "who deadly" section of the who list).  You may
   have more than one character online as long as &Wnone&G of your characters
   are listed under the "who deadly" section of the who list.
 
 - using multiple characters to spam any player or channel via making all
   characters say/tell/chat/avtalk a same message or series of messages
   is highly frowned upon and may earn each character a silence.
 
&WNOTE:&G  Link-dead characters are not considered to be "online."
 
~

-1 'LAW MURDER'~
.
&GPlayer killing is decided the instant you cast any hostile spell or make
any aggressive action against a non-deadly player.  Actually killing the
target means little.  The only form of player killing allowed is between
players whose names appear on "who deadly" section of the who list.  A
battle between non-deadly characters is still illegal even if those who
are involved have agreed to the combat.
 
Being involved in an illegal pkill is a serious violation of law, and can
result in a stay in hell, slay, loss of all equipment, freeze and/or deny
or site ban. 
 
~

-1 'LAW OBJECTS'~
.
&GIf you notice an item on the ground and there is a player in the room with
it, do _not_ pick it up without first getting permission from the person<s>
in the room.  Taking such items may be considered stealing if you do not
first obtain permission from those present.
 
Do not simply take an item to identify it without asking permission.  If
you are asked to drop an item you picked up, do so immediately.
 
Do not take items laying next to a corpse, even if no one is present,
without asking the owner of the corpse if the item(s) belong to them.
 
Do not take items from a mob corpse unless you made the kill yourself or
you have specific permission from the character who made the kill.  This
includes removing gold from a corpse.
 
* &WWarning:&G  It is never wise to leave items or containers unattended and
  expect them to be there when you return.  If there is an item on the
  ground and there is neither a corpse nor a player in the room, the
  object is considered abandoned and free for the taking.
 
~

-1 'LAW PKILL'~
.
&GDeadly Characters are those which appear on the who list under the section
titled "Deadly Characters" (type 'who deadly').  A character must be level
5 _and_ 18 years of age to officially become deadly; if you are a pkill
character who doesn't fill these criteria yet, you will not appear under
'who deadly' and are _not_ yet able to pkill.
 
Deadly characters may &Wnot&G:
 a) multi-play while using a deadly character
 b) be shared
 c) receive help (healing, shielding, portaling, etc.) from non-deadlies
 d) receive Immortal corpse retrievals or reimbursements - no exceptions
 e) attack players more than 5 levels outside their own
    - includes picking up disarmed weapons from someone outside your range
    - includes healing a fighting character outside your range
    - includes looting the corpse of someone outside your level range
 
Deadly characters are allowed to:
 a) pkill another player who appears on the deadly
    list (who deadly) who is within 5 levels of their own.
 b) loot the corpse of the fallen deadly player, provided they were
    the tank or delt the killing blow.
 c) use mobs within or lower than the pkill level range of the victim
 
&WWarning&G:  Going AFK or link-dead in a non-safe area leaves you open to
attack; a deadly is open to attack every second online, link-live or not.
 
~

-1 'LAW SHARING'~
.
&GCharacter sharing (when allowed) is always done at the risk of the players
involved.  Immortals will &Wnot&G recover any character lost to trading or
sharing.  Whoever owns the password owns the character.
 
A character may &Wnot&G be shared if:
 - the character is a deadly character
 - the character holds any leadership position in a Guild or Order
 
~

-1 'LAW SPAM'~
No, we are not talking about a luncheon meat here.  Spam is the repeated use
of a phrase, command, or channel that causes screen scroll for others.  Not
only is spam considered rude, but excessive screen scroll can interfere with
the game play of anyone seeing it (not to mention combat situations).  The
game will also tell you to PUT A LID ON IT and force-quit you after the 20th
repeat of a single command
 
It is also considered spam to use the same phrase over several different
channels.  The use of all-caps can also be considered spam.  Only use
capitals to add emphasis to key words in a sentence.
 
Moving a large number of items into and out of a container in a crowded, 
non-store room is considered spam.  Using multiple characters to chat the
same message at the same time is considered spam.  Making charmed mobs
or pets to cause screen scroll through movement or orders is considered
spam. ANYTHING that causes excessive or irritating screen scroll can be
considered spam.
 
~

-1 'LAW STAKE'~
.
&GThe first player to attack a mob has the rights to the kill.  Others should
not get involved without being requested to do so.  Those receiving aid are 
under no obligation to reward their benefactors.  Monopolization of a mob and
its repops will not be tolerated.
 
Any disputes brought to the attention of an immortal for resolution will be
handled according the the immortal's discretion.  All such decisions are final.
~

-1 'LAW STORES'~
.
&GShopkeepers inside Darkhaven are protected by the laws of the city's Lord,
Duke Luther.  As the gods have pledged their favor to Darkhaven, they have
imbued these shopkeepers with the powers necessary to carry out retribution
against those who defy these laws.  In short, anyone who chooses to attack
a Darkhaven shopkeeper will die brutally.  In addition, they may find
themselves facing the direct wrath of the gods in hell...
 
Those caught stealing from these shopkeepers will be incarcerated by the
guards of the Duke until such time as their release is granted by the gods.
 
A Darkhaven shopkeeper is any mob inside Darkhaven at which you can type
'list'.  If you are given a list of items for sale, or are told to try
back later, it is a shopkeeper.  This also applies to guild shopkeepers
and the blacksmith.
 
~

101 LAYERS~
.
&gLayers are currently available on the following wear locations:
 
&GAbout, Arms, Body, Feet, Hands, Legs, Waist.
 
&gLayers are set with a numeric value, or combination of values. The lower the
value, the lower the layer, or thinner the item of clothing/armor is. Valid
numeric values are:
 
&G0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.
 
&gOr any combination of the above. A value of zero means no other items came
be layered with this item. Items of clothing can be layered over one another
as long as their layer values do not overlap. ie, if leather armor were set
to a value of 56 (8, 16, and 32), it could not layer with, say, a set of
heavy chain that is set to a value of 96 (32 and 64), as they overlap on the
layer value of 32.
 
It is suggested that only those items that will occupy the highest value 
slots, or a slot of 0, have any special affects added to them. Underclothing
should only have a.c. settings.

1 LCK LUCK~
Luck (LCK in your 'score') represents the tendency of a character to succeed
or prosper through chance or good fortune.  As in life, the exact extent of
this factor remains and will always remain shrouded in uncertainty...
 
Also as in life, however, it can be said with surety that its influence on a
character is pervasive.  Though it affects some aspects of life here in a
very direct manner, it can affect nearly every aspect to at least a degree.
 
~

1 LEAP~
Syntax:  leap
 
Leap is a skill which can only be used once a fight has started, and
can only be used against your primary opponent.  If it successfully
lands, it inflicts damage on your opponent.

-1 LIZARDMAN LIZARDMEN LIZARD-MAN LIZARD-MEN 'LIZARD MAN' 'LIZARD MEN'~
Lizardmen are semi-aquatic, breathing air but often dwelling totally
underwater.  They are often noted to use underwater caves as their
lair, and are typically found in swamps, marshes, and similar places.
Members of this race band together in rough tribal form; they are
omnivores, and are likely to prefer human flesh to other foods.
Due to this taste for humans, they suffer if their alignment strays
too much towards the honorable side of the spectrum.

This race, of course, has the innate ability to breath under water.

Lizard men gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.91
~

102 LOADUP~
Syntax:  loadup <player>
 
LOADUP allows one to load up a player's character (playing or not), to do
whatever needs be done to the character.  (Modifying a flag, changing a
password... etc).  Use FORCE to make the character do your bidding.
 
If we make any changes to the char, we comment the char and place a note in
their inventory explaining who loaded them up and what changes were made.
The character is transed to room 99 and forced to quit there (unless they
are going to be left in hell).  If we don't make any changes to the char, we
trans them back from where they came and force quit them there.  Loadup is
used primarily when a player quits to avoid dealing with immortals or if
they quit before you finish writing a comment.  But it is also used to
investigate chars for duping and other allegations made against them.
 
So... there is actually a wide range of reasons to use loadup and you are
encouraged to use your discretion in this area.
 
If you load up a character to slay or purge them, you must post in 1205.
 
See FORCE
~

0 'LOCATE OBJECT'~
Syntax: cast 'locate object' <name>

This spell reveals the location of all objects with the given name.
~

102 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax: log   <character>
Syntax: log   all
Syntax: snoop <character>

LOG <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like FREEZE, it is a permanent character toggle.

Certain commands (PASSWORD) are protected against LOG.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

LOG ALL logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots.

SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time.
The input from the player will be displayed with a header of the players 
name and a percentage sign (i.e. Mudder%)
SNOOP yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
-- Do not snoop people being intimate. <i.e. Mudsex, voyeurism, etc...>
-- Do not repeat information learned in snoop casually, especially to mortals
-- Only snoop a person talking to a higher level Immortal with the higher
   Immortals "Express Permission".
-- If a higher level Immortal begins communication with someone you are
     snooping, inform that higher Immortal immediately of the snoop.
-- Any incidental references learned in snoop should be disregarded
    ** For example, you hear someone is having a mud affair, it is not
    ** important to the reason you are snooping.  Do not judge or pass
    ** on information learned in this manner.
-- "Spot check" snooping of lower level Immortals is part of being a higher
   level immortal.  All Immortals may be snooped at any time, for any reason.
-- Do not snoop for the purpose of gaining information for personal reasons.
-- Being an Immortal is a privilege and a job.  Snoop is a tool to assist
   you do your job properly.  Snoop is neither a toy nor a right.

power.  They will become a powerful fighting force.  Armed with an
arsenal of various spells, with the main focus in combat spells.  Their

-1 MENTALSTATE MENTALSTATES 'MENTAL STATE' 'MENTAL STATES'~
.
&gYour mental state is your current frame of mind, and how clearly and
realistically you view your surroundings.  Mental states can be affected
by prolonged combat, hunger, thirst, or poison.  If you are affected by
one of the above for a period of time, your mental state will begin to
deteriorate, and you will not view your surroundings as they truly are.
You may begin to hallucinate, or become too lethargic to function, and
your general abilities will be affected.  In extreme cases you may
collapse from exhaustion or enter a delirious coma.
 
To restore your mental state, you may need to rest (resting and sleeping
will speed your recovery), eat, cure whatever poison afflicts you, etc.
Note that if you are malnourished your state will &wnot&g improve, even with
sleep, until you have fed and/or quenched your thirst.
 
Your mental state is by the text line in 'score' which describes your state
of mind (You feel great, etc.)  The 'group' display contains a less accurate
reading of your and your group-mates' mentalstates as well.
 
Note:  Changing your deity now affects your mental state.

weapon missile wielded (Only certain weapons are able to be missile wielded)
and must have an appropriate ammunition in inventory.

Example: To use a bow and arrow, one must have a bow missile wielded and
have an arrow in inventory.
 
See help &Wfire and help &Wfletch
~

101 MISSILES~
Creating a projectile is basically the same as making any other
weapon. The exception to this are its Values (see ITEMVALUES)
and the need to have missiles which match missileweapons.
 
&GFollow this basic proceedure to make a set of projectiles&W:
  1) Create a firing mechanism, for instance, a long bow.
  2) Set the itemtype to 'missileweapon'.
  3) Set the wearflags to 'take missile'
  4) Set the projectile values from the HELP ITEMVALUES table.
  5) Set the Value3 (V3) from the table in HELP WEAPONTYPES.
 
&G Now the wielded weapon is done, but you need something to fire...&W
  1) Create a shootable object, for instance, an arrow.
  2) Set the itemtype to 'projectile'
  3) Set the wearflags to 'take'.
  4) Set the projectile values from the HELP ITEMVALUES table.
  5) Set the V3 to match the V3 on the firing mechanism you created.
 
Don't forget to finish the items with weight, cost, long, short etc.
You now have two objects in inventory which are ready to fire.
Lastly, you may create a quiver for certain objects. To do this,
set the itemtype to 'quiver', and use v0 to set its capacity.
Be sure not to set the capacity too high, as quivers should be small.

fall to your knees, and release your bladder... 

The next second, the immense mass of slimey muscle and claws is all over you
...shredding you to a bloody mess!

Mercifully, everything goes black as it moves its widening maw towards your
head...
~

-1 M_GODLVL1_~
...Everything begins to fade to black.

You feel yourself leaving your body... rising up into the air, you feel
indeed much more free than you have ever felt before...

You float high into the heavens... a vortex of ever-changing curved beams
of colored light swirling around you faster and faster...

Your soul is bursting with emotions you can barely conceive...
You feel a burning inside... both cold and hot... a tingle of electricity
grows into a powerful buzzing surge jolting through every inch of your body.

A strange chorus of voices begins to sing indecipherable and long forgotten
words... the singing grows louder and louder... a million voices as one.

You feel yourself losing touch with reality... and all goes quiet.
~

-1 M_GODLVL2_~

powers...

You feel that you have earned some trust and respect among your peers,
yet you know that your jouney has only just begun.
~

-1 M_GODLVL3_~
...You begin to feel light-headed.

Your hands begin to tingle softly...
The feeling quickly grows into a strange radiating pulse of energy! 

The tingle rises up your arms and into your head, filing your mind with
visions of worlds of wonder, far off places, great towers, vast mountains,
oceans, seas, lush valleys, dark caverns and twisted passages...
 
You sense a feeling of wonderous potential and power in your hands...
Enough power to build and create these visions for yourself!

You feel much more powerful, eager and inspired!
~

-1 M_GODLVL4_~
...You feel slightly faint as your head begins to spin.

Your hands begin to tingle once more...
A vortex of energy starts to swirl throughout your hands, going faster
and faster... becoming almost painful! 

Beams of light break through your skin, one at a time, then more and
more until the light is almost to bright to bear...

As your squint your eyes, you perceive a vision of great beasts of wonder,
dangerous and unnatural fiends, pixies, faeries, tribes and clans, peoples
of all kinds, ancient forgotten artifacts, weapons of vast untapped powers,
crystal balls, magick rings, staves, wands, rods, arcane tomes of untold
secrets... your mind is bursting with inspiration...
 
You sense a new, reborn feeling of unlimited potential and power...
In your hands the power to build and create these visions for yourself!

The bright light from your hands fades away... but strange faint glow
remains always.

1 NAME NAMES~
&YSyntax:  name <newname>&W
 
This command allows a pre-authorization player to change their name to
a new one if their original choice has been denied.
  Example: A new player named Pete has his name denied. To change his
  name to 'Joe', Pete would simply type: &YName Joe&W.
 
When choosing a name, please try to choose one which is both medieval
and unique. Good names help add to gameplay and will allow you to forge
an identity for yourself. Simply put, your name should &YNOT &Wbe:&G

 - Nonsensical, unpronounceable or ridiculous.
 - Profane or derogatory as interpreted in any language.
 - Futuristic or common, such as 'Jill' or 'Laser'.
 - Similar to that of any Realms Immortal, major mob, or equipment.
 - Significant in history, mythology, or any religion.
 - Comprised of various capital letters, such as 'BrACkkA' or 'CORTO'.
 - Comprised of ranks or titles, such as 'Lord' or 'Master'.
 - Composed of singular descriptive nouns, adverbs or adjectives,
    as in 'Heart', 'Big', 'Flying', 'Broken', 'Slick' or 'Tricky'.
 - Any of the above in reverse, i.e., writing Jade as 'Edaj'.
 - Any combination of singular descriptive nouns/adverbs or adjectives, as
   in 'Metaljacket Heartbound Earthstone or Softheart'.
 
&WPlease keep in mind that names which were authed in the past do
not validate current name authing. Above are the guidelines
which all immortals follow. In addition, they may have their own
reasons for denying your name. The final determination as to the
validity of a name on the Realms is the discretion of the Immortals
and is NOT subject to debate or discussion. If your name is denied,
simply follow the guidelines and try a new one.

-1 PALADIN PALADINS~
The Paladin
___________________________________________________________
"You are the most excellent of men and your lips have been anointed with
grace, since God has blessed you forever.  Gird your sword upon your side,
O mighty one; clothe yourself with splendor and majesty.
 
In your majesty ride forth victoriously in behalf of truth, humility and
righteousness; let your right hand display awesome deeds. 
 
Let your sharp arrows pierce the hearts of the king's enemies; let the
nations fall beneath your feet...
 
You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God, your God, has 
set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy...
 
I will perpetuate your memory through all generations; therefore the
nations will praise you for ever and ever..."
___________________________________________________________
 
Paladins are warrior priests who draw their power from acts of righteousness
and strict adherence to the Code of The Temple of Solomon.  Their strength
in battle, combined with the ability to perform limited miracles is offset
by the difficulty they experience in perfecting their craft, and the penalties
they suffer when they stray from the path of good.

0 PASSWORD~
Syntax:  password  <new password>   <new password>
 
PASSWORD changes your character's password.  You repeat the new password only.
If you do not get it correctly it will not work.  This should end the typo
locking you out of your character.
The PASSWORD command is protected against being snooped or logged; it is
impossible for any immortal to in any way see, find or retrieve it.  It
is the responsibility of the player to ensure that the password of the
character is kept secure.
 
Passwords can not contain certain characters, or spaces.  We also advise
that you use an alphanumeric password (one containing both numbers and
letters) as they are harder to guess.  We also recommend that you choose
a password that is greater than 6 characters in length.  A good rule of
thumb is if it is in the dictionary, it is probably not a good password.
 
NOTE:  if you decide to trade a character, you do so at your own risk.
Immortals are not responsible for ensuring fair trades.  You may seek an
immortal to oversee a trade, but it is not their  responsibility.
 
&YThe password policy is:  password equals ownership.&w

~

2 PASSWORD_ZMUD~
When you're using zMUD and want to change your password, remember to change
it in the zMUD character settings as well as on the mud.  The MUD's command
for this is:  password <new password> <new password>
In zMUD, click on 'File', then 'Another Character', or 'File', then 'Open'
to access the character settings - and change the password there.
If you have forgotten your character's password but can still log on with
the character, you can still find out what the password is.  Log on with
that character, click on 'View', then 'Preferences' and then click on
General Settings'.  Find the checkbox for 'Gag Password' and make sure the
box is not checked.  Click on 'Ok' to close the dialog box.
Type the command #say %pass [enter].  Your password will be shown on your
screen, but not sent to the mud.  Write it down, for future reference.

1 QUIT~
Syntax: QUIT
 
QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game
you will be back in the same room, unless that room has a prog that moves
you upon re-entry.
 
QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just
one command.  Nevertheless, it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you
get into the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other
mud that doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.
 
There is no RENT here.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~

2 RACETALK~
Syntax:  racetalk <message>
 
The racetalk channel will send your message to all the members of
your race currently online.  This channel can be used to roleplay
in accordance with the characteristics of your race, to plan runs
or grouping with a more focused body of players, or for general
chatter.  Please note that racetalk is partially designed to
promote roleplaying, so attempting to limit yourself to the
characteristics of your race may enhance your enjoyment of the mud,
and may provide a unique experience for those who have never
roleplayed previously.

0 RANGER~
A ranger is the outdoorsman and adventuresome free spirit of the times.  A
self-sufficent person, the ranger is adaptable and can survive in almost
any locale.  Skilled with weapons and able to utilize some of the finest
armor available, a ranger is physically skilled enough to take on most any
foe.  However, for especially hardy opponents, a ranger also can cast many
useful spells to both hinder his opponent and aid himself.  From minor
curative magics to blinding his enemy, the ranger is the most adept class
at surviving on its own.  A ranger typically travels light, but he does
have the mighty strength of a warrior to carry equipment needed in his
travels.  Like the druid (the class other than warrior that he most
closely resembles), his need for help from outside sources is low.
 
~

101 RAP~
This command allows you to rap on a closed passageway and anyone on the
other side will "hear" it.  The message sent is an act_message, and
act_progs can be trigger by it.

This commands seems awfully pointless, right now.
~

103 RASSIGN MASSIGN OASSIGN~
Syntax: rassign
        oassign 
        massign

> Steps for creating a new area from scratch;
> 1. checkvnum rooms   low_vnum hi_vnum
>    checkvnum objects low_vnum hi_vnum
>    checkvnum mobs    low_vnum hi_vnum

> your area.
NEVER do this to someone who has an area assigned to them. This would
change the range for the area they have assigned and wipe out the area.
~

103 RAT~
Syntax: rat vnum1 vnum2 command [parameters]
 
Rat, or 'range at' is the at command with the added parameters of two
room vnums.  Assuming the vnums are valid, your 'at' command will be
executed in every room in the range you give.
 
Example: rat 100 110 redit flags 0
This will clear the room flags in all rooms from 100 to 110 inclusive.
~

0 RAZORBAIT~
This spell makes the victim more susceptible to stabbing attacks.
~

103 REBOOT SHUTDOWN WIZLOCK~
Syntax: reboot <nosave>
Syntax: shutdown <nosave>
Syntax: wizlock

REBOOT shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of sixty seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

SHUTDOWN shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

WIZLOCK is a toggle command.  When the server is WIZLOCKed, players
below level 51 may not log in.  Players who lose their links, however,
may reconnect.

If nosave is specified for reboot or shutdown, it will not automatically 
save all of the players.
~

1 RECALL~
With a scroll or potion of 'word of recall' you can instantly return from
most areas to your attuned recall spot (Thoth's Rune in Darkhaven for any
those who are not deadly, clanned or a member of an Order or Guild).
 
Scrolls of recall are available in Darkhaven's section of magic shoppes.
 
See also: 'word of recall'
 
~

0 'RECHARGE'~
Syntax: cast 'recharge' <wand/staff>

This spell is used to recharge wands and staves after use.  The mage
or cleric performing the recharge should always insure the item is
not fully charged, as overcharging is considered dangerous.  Also,
there is always a small chance of destroying the staff, or in even 
rarer instances multiplying the charges available.
~

101 REDIT~
Syntax: REDIT FIELD [parameter list]
        REDIT ON
 
FIELD  | PARAMETERS             -- DESCRIPTION / NOTES
---------------------------------------------------------------------
name   | <room name>            -- sets the room name / short description
exit   | <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keywords]
bexit  | same as above, but does the exit in both directions
desc   | none                   -- you will be placed into the buffer editor
exdesc | <direction> [text]     -- sets/clears an exit's description
ed     | <keyword(s)>           -- adds/edits an extra description to the room
rmed   | <keyword(s)>           -- removes an extra description from the room
sector | <value>                -- sets the sector type
flags  | <flag> [flag]          -- toggles room flags
exflags| <direction> [flags]    -- displays/toggles exit flags
exname | <direction> [keywords] -- sets an exit's keywords
exkey  | <direction> <key vnum> -- sets an exit's key vnum/value
 
Note: Put a '+' before the direction to force ADDing of that exit
      and use a '#' to specify the exit by sequential order.
 
REDIT ON will lock you into a mode in which 'redit' is implied in each command
sequence, and hitting enter will give you an instant rstat of whichever room
you are in at the time. To get out of REDIT ON, simply type the word DONE. 
Example:
 
        redit on
        name A dark and forboding hallway
        flags dark indoors
        done
 
 
See EXITTYPES, EXFLAGS, EXITMAKING, SECTORTYPES and ROOMFLAGS.
 
~

0 REFRESH~
Syntax: cast refresh <character>

This spell refreshes the movement points of a character who is out of movement
points.
~

1 REKEY~
Rekey changes the keyword of an item.
It differs from rename in that it is not the name that is seen, but the
name the object is identified as and can be looked at or picked up as.
For example, if a sword of legend was rekeyed to blade , get sword would
no longer work with this item. (get blade would pick up the item)

   When an item is rekeyed, one of the words from the short description
     &GMUST&W be used in the rekey.
 
Rekey is included in the rename fee. See help glory for more information.
~

1 REMAINS~
Syntax:  remains
 
A worshipper may request knowledge on the disposition of their remains
from his or her deity (meaning the location and remaining time before
complete decay).  However, the imposition comes at the cost of a small
amount of favor -- approximately twice that of the character's level.
 
If no remains exist, there is no penalty to favor.
 
SEE ALSO:  supplicate
~

0 'REMOVE CURSE'~
Syntax: cast 'remove curse' <character>

This spell removes a curse from a character, or one of the objects a
character is carrying or using.
~

0 'REMOVE TRAP'~
Syntax: cast 'remove trap' <object>

This spell will magically disarm a trap on an object.
~

1 RENAME~
A rename may be done by a level 54 or higher immortal.  If you wish
for the rekey to be completed at the same time, you must contact a
level 56 or higher immortal.  The rename can be purchased with 20
glory or a rename scroll.  Wedding renames are done with a marriage
license by Blorin, the Darkhaven engraver.  (See help wedding)
Renames are to be medieval in style for mortals and must not contain
the name of an immortal without their expressed consent.  Items will
not be renamed to machine gun, silly putty, etc.
Before contacting an immortal to redeem glory or scrolls for a rename,
please have in mind what you would like done.  You will need to consider
the following:
Short description - what is seen when the item is worn by a person.
Long description - what is seen when the item is lying on the ground.
Rekey - the renaming of the item (usually something from the short desc)
 
~

1 REPAIR~
Syntax:   repair <object>
          repair all
 
Repair allows you to repair equipment and swords at metal blacksmiths,
and recharge staves and wands at magical 'blacksmiths.'  Repair all
attempts to repair every item in your inventory.
 
There is a 10% surcharge for using "repair all". This surcharge is for
the convenience of having all the equipment in your inventory repaired
at once.
 
~

101 REPAIRSET~
Syntax:  repairset <mobile vnum> <field> <value>
 
This command allows you to set the following fields for repair shops:
 
-----------------------------------------------
| Fields | Meaning                            |
-----------------------------------------------
| fix#   | Types of items the keeper will fix |
|        |  - armor, weapon, wand, staff      |
| profit | Profit on fixing items             |
| type   | Repair shop type                   |
|        |   type 1 = standard                |
|        |   type 2 = recharge                |
| open   | Hour shop opens                    |
| close  | Hour shop closes                   |
| keeper | Vnum of repair shop keeper         |

~

101 REPEAT~
Syntax: repeat <letter>
 
This command will repeat tell messages which you
have already received. If no parameters are given
it will simply produce the last tell you received.
If a single letter is given, then the last tell
sent to you by a character with a name starting
with that letter will be displayed. This is an imm
only command.
~

1 REPOP~
Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if there are no characters in
in the area; less often (15 minutes) if any characters are present.  Also
note that objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone
is in the area when it resets.
 
Area resets are indicated by 'squeaking noises' just prior to the reset.
~

1 'REPORT' 'TIME' 'WEATHER'~
Syntax: report;  Syntax: time;  Syntax: weather
 
REPORT shows your current statistics to you and also announces them to other
players in the room.
 
TIME shows the game time, as well as the time the mud was last started,
and the current local time for the host computer.
 
WEATHER shows the current game weather.  You must be in an outside room
to see the weather.
~

105 RESERVE~
.
The "Reserve" command enables us to specify certain names that are
reserved and cannot be used by players.
 
We can specify names that we want to reserve because they belong to
former imms (like Narn and Dominus). We can specify names that are
often tried and are a bit of a pain (like Killer or Satan or Seth).
 
We can specify parts of names by preceding the string with an "*">
e.g.  reserve *goof
This will prevent any name with the substring "goof" ... like ...
"goofface", "biggoof" or "biggoofface".
All deity names should be reserved.
 
reserve                        list current reserved names
reserve joe                    add joe to the list if he's not on it
reserve joe                    remove joe to the list if he is on it
reserve *goof                  add the substring "goof" to the list

Syntax: reset area   (will "reset" your area based on the defined resets)

WARNING:
  The order that resets are in is VERY important.  You cannot equip
  a mobile with an object before putting the mobile into a room first.
  Likewise, you cannot put an object into a container until the container is
  put into a room first.

This command is used to display, edit, delete, add and insert resets for
your area.
See INSTAZONE and RESETCMDS.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can also WAKE
other sleeping characters.

        restore all

RESTORE restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.  RESTORE ALL does this for all mortals except player
killers and any who happen to be in the arena.
 
A note on RESTORE ALL: This is a gift from the gods, and it is never 
planned in advance or done on request.  The best way to ensure that a
restore all will NOT be done is to ask for one.
~

101 RESTORETIME~
Restoretime shows you how much time has passed since you last did a
restore all. All Immortals between the levels of 53 and 56 can do one
restore all per 18 hours of Real Time. Those of level 57+ can restore
all at any given time, upon their discretion.

Sacrifice offers an object to the gods, or to your Order or Clan's deity.
The gods may reward you for the sacrifice, and the nature of the reward
depends upon the type of object.
 
Hint: the gods like corpses.
~

0 SAGACITY~
This spell increases your wisdom for its duration.
~

0 SALVE APPLY~
In your travels you may come across various ointments and salves.
Use 'apply <itemname>' to rub some of the salve onto your skin.
 
( For Smaug Release.. A sample salve is available in vnum 21084)
~

1 SAVE~
Syntax:  Save
 
SAVE saves your character and its inventory; you must be at least second
level to save.  The system automatically saves approximately one character
every minute, but with the high number of players usually online it may take
hours before your own is auto-saved.  For this reason, you should not
rely on auto-save to keep your character updated -- save frequently.
 
Type SAVE immediately after recovering your corpse, gaining experience or
a level in battle, getting new items, making purchases or repairs, etc.
 
Some objects (such as keys) may not be saved.  You cannot SAVE and QUIT
with objects of a higher level than your own, as they will vanish when
you log out.  Every character is auto-saved at reboot.

~

1 SAVE POSITIONS~
At current time, there are 14 "positions" in the game. Positions
are in a special order.  If position b is below position a on the
list, that indicates that while in position b, you have more 
physical or mental energy to spend on a task, be it a command,
a spell, or a skill.
 
For example, while standing, you have a greater ability to do things
than while sitting.  While fighting evasively, you have more options
than while fighting aggressively.
 
The ordered list is as follows, left to right, top to bottom:
Dead          Mortally Wounded        Incapacitated
Stunned       Sleeping                Fighting (Berserk)
Resting       Fighting (Aggressive)   Sitting
Fighting (Std)Fighting (Defensive)    Fighting (Evasive)
Standing      Mounted

101 SAVEAREA LOADAREA~
Syntax: savearea
        loadarea

Savearea and loadarea will save or load your prototype area.
~

104 SAVEFLAGS~
Save flags are the flags used with 'cset saveflag' to define when a pfile is
saved automatically. For example dropping an item. It could, potentially, be
bad to not save at that point. Why, you ask? Say you have one of the more
powerful quest weapon in the game. Drop it really fast and quit. Log in now.

forced them into the general populace.

103 SETBOOT~
Syntax: setboot time <hour> <minute>
 	setboot manual <0|1>

The setboot command is useful for planning a reboot, (to save you from 
the trouble of all those echos :) ) and for the daily boot.  The manual
bit is used by the mud to determine whether the boot time was set by 
hand.  When the mud starts up, the boot time is set to 0600hrs (6am)
and the manual bit to 0.  If 'setboot time' is used, the mud sets the
manual bit to 1.  When it comes time to do the reboot, the mud checks
how long it has been running.  If it has been running less than 18 
hours and the reboot time has not been set manually, the reboot does
not take place (nor do the automatic warning echoes).

Echoes: when a scheduled reboot is coming up, the mud will send out
echoes to that effect.  The echoes start 30 minutes before the reboot
and are repeated at t minus 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 minute(s).

1 'SPECTRAL FUROR' 'HAND OF CHAOS'~
After the Dark Mage Thanatos accidentally discovered the spell
'Disruption' in a failed attempt to create a teleportation magic,
he spent many years studying how to increase the pain that can
be inflicted by incorrectly moving a victim across the threshold
of dimensions.  
 
 'Spectral Furor' is a formula which, by upsetting the very nature
of the space the victim inhabits causes neural as well as brute
physical damage.
 
With 'Hand of Chaos,' Thanatos perfected this line of magic, and he
returned to his researches on the art of astral travel.

1 STR STRENGTH~
Strength (STR in your 'score') represents your character's physical power.

can carry.  For each additional point of strength  you gain an additional
amount of maximum carryable weight.  Any character with 20 strength can
carry 500kgs; Warriors and Rangers can have a maximum of 25 strength, and
can therefore carry up to 999kgs when their strength is at its maximum.
 
Strength also affects (among other things):
 
 - damage roll and hitroll; for each additional point of strength, each
   of these will increase
 
 - chances of success for bash, stun, bashdoor, shove and drag, and the
   ability to dual-wield heavier weapons
 
Strength is the prime attribute of warriors, rangers and paladins.

0 THIEF THIEVES~
The thief is a dark character which makes use of many skills often deemed
improper by the rest of society. Known to haunt the darkest roads and
alleys. The skills of the thief reflect his way of life, be it sneaking,
peeking into others' inventories, picking locks, or attacking from behind
with deadly backstabs. With amazing dexterity they have the ability to
circle around an enemy, but for living such a dark life, thieves have
always had a bad reputation so don't be suprised if you are always under
suspicion. Thieves start off fairly weak, but as they gain skills such as
backstab and circle they soon become dangerous foes.  A thief is always
useful when there is  a lock that needs pryed, or an item that one wishes
to acquire without detection.
 
~

0 TICK~
Many of the actions in the Realms are based upon interval timers, including
combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell
duration, weather, and area resetting.
 
Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks in these Realms average 60 seconds of real time, but the
actual amount varies randomly from 45 seconds to 75 seconds.
 
Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if there are no characters in
in the area; less often (15 minutes) if any characters are present; Also,
some lower level areas have shorter reset periods, while some higher level
areas have longer reset periods.
 
Note that objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone is
in the area when it resets.
 
Area resets are indicated by 'squeaking noises' or other messages just prior
to the reset itself.

Shortened names will also work.  e.x., users fre would show
Fredrick and Fred if they were on at the time.
The first number, (desc), is the descriptor number that this user is on.
The second number is the user's connected state.  (See CONSTATES)
The third number is the number of seconds the user has been idle.
The fourth number is the remote TCP port on the user's host machine.

0 WARRIOR WARRIORS~
Warriors are the epitome of fighters, able to use all weaponry and armour
in the exercise of their most lethal of combat skills.  A warrior must be
strong in body to survive his dangerous lifestyle, and though he has no
magic and limited skills he is nevertheless a formidable force with which
to be reckoned.  Warriors learn no magic, and have no use for mana.

&W Syntax: &G watch print 500 100    &W Shows 100 lines starting at line 500

Watch will work 24 hours a day from the time you put a watch on a player until
you take it off. You can also watch all players from a specific site.
 
We need you to be real careful about the size of your watch file. If you
are watching a number of players or sites, please do not just forget about
your watches and allow your watch file to grow to outrageous sizes. You
should never have more than 5,000 or 10,000 lines in your watch file.
If you are doing some watching, be sure you check your watch file daily
and either print it, display it, copy it to your hard drive or do whatever
you need to do with it but then ... please ... please ... be sure you
clear it so that it don't grow huge and eat up all our hard drive space.
If you clear your watch file daily ... there should be no problem. If you
aren't watching anyone ... you don't have to worry about this. But if you
start a watch, it is your responsibility to know how big your watch file
is and to stop the watch when you no longer need it. The command
&G"watch size" &W tells you how many lines are in your watch file.
The command &G"watch clear"&W clears (deletes) your watch file.
For the time being the maximum number of lines you can display at one time
is 1000. So ... even if you have 5,000 lines in your watch file ... you can
only display 1,000 at a time.

1 WEAPONS~
Weapons are the primary source of fighting power for most classes,
especially at lower levels where other skills and spells remain
unlearned. To use a weapon, simply 'wield <weapon name>'. You will
hit more frequently with a weapon which is suited to your class, so
choose your weapon wisely. For instance, mages use short blades at 95%
efficiency. A mage wielding a long blade would hit his/her target less
frequently, dependant upon the hitroll of the weapon in hand. Also, be
sure to practice and adept your favored weapontype for best results.

~

101 WIZHELP~
Syntax: wizhelp

WIZHELP provides a list of all the immortal commands.
~

101 WIZINVIS~
All immortals have the responsibility to be available to others whenever
possible, be they mortal or immortal.  When the use of wizinvis is called
for, the following are parameters for its use:
 
 - Immortals level 101 through 102 should be visible at all times, save
   for when snooping, running a quest or some similar circumstance.
 
 - Immortals level 103 and up may invis to any level at their discretion.
 
Guidelines for use of wizinvis by 103 and higher:
It is considered mandatory to be visible to all other immortals whenever
reasonably able to do so.  Using wizinvis beyond 101 to facilitate work on
a project, allow concentration on something, avoid excessive tells or the
like is fine, but it should only be used while necessary.
 
Guidelines for use of wizinvis beyond 101 in immortal channels:
Sightings of Someones in immortal channels should be kept to a minimum.
If you are free enough to be able to use an immortal channel, you should
be visible to the lowest immortal in that channel; no higher than 103 in
Muse, no higher than 101 in immtalk, etc.  Being a Someone to anyone on
an immortal channel should only occur if you're too tied up to go
visible but need to make a comment.
 
The same applies to all situations using channels, tells or actions.
Avoid being a Someone to mortals and immortals alike unless you have
a good reason to do otherwise.
